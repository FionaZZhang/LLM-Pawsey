Water and Climate Change2Climate change will affect the availability, quality and quantity of water for basic human needs, threatening the \\neffective enjoyment of the human rights to water and sanitation for potentially billions of people. The hydrological \\nchanges induced by climate change will add challenges to the sustainable management of water resources, which \\nare already under severe pressure in many regions of the world. \\nFood security, human health, urban and rural settlements, energy production, industrial development, economic \\ngrowth, and ecosystems are all water-dependent and thus vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Climate \\nchange adaptation and mitigation through water management is therefore critical to sustainable development, \\nand essential to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change \\nand the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.\\nImpacts on water resources\\nGlobal water use has increased by a factor of six over the past 100 years and continues to grow steadily at a \\nrate of about 1% per year as a result of increasing population, economic development and shifting consumption \\npatterns. Combined with a more erratic and uncertain supply, climate change will aggravate the situation of \\ncurrently water-stressed regions, and generate water stress in regions where water resources are still abundant \\ntoday. Physical water scarcity is often a seasonal phenomenon, rather than a chronic one, and climate change is \\nlikely to cause shifts in seasonal water availability throughout the year in several places.\\nClimate change manifests itself, amongst others, in the increasing frequency and magnitude of extreme events \\nsuch as heatwaves, unprecedented rainfalls, thunderstorms and storm surge events.\\nWater quality will be adversely affected as a result of higher water temperatures, reduced dissolved oxygen and \\nthus a reduced self-purifying capacity of freshwater bodies. There are further risks of water pollution and \\npathogenic contamination caused by flooding or by higher pollutant concentrations during drought.\\nMany ecosystems, particularly forests and wetlands, are also at risk. The \\ndegradation of ecosystems will not only lead to biodiversity loss, but also affect the \\nprovision of water-related ecosystem services, such as water purification, carbon \\ncapture and storage, and natural flood protection, as well as the provision of water \\nfor agriculture, fisheries and recreation.\\nMuch of the impacts of climate change will be manifested in the tropical zones \\nwhere most of the developing world can be found. Small island developing states \\nare typically environmentally and socio-economically vulnerable to disasters and \\nclimate change, and many will experience increasing water stress. Across the planet, \\ndrylands are expected to expand significantly. Accelerated melting of glaciers is \\nexpected to have a negative effect on the water resources of mountain regions and \\ntheir adjacent lowlands.\\nDespite the growing evidence that the changing climate will affect the availability and distribution of water \\nresources, some uncertainties remain, especially at local and basin scales. While there is not much disagreement \\nabout the temperature increases, which have been simulated by different general circulation models (GCMs) \\nunder specific scenario conditions, more variability and ambiguity exist in projected precipitation trends. Often, \\ntrends in extremes (heavier precipitation, heat, prolonged droughts) show a clearer direction than trends in annual \\nprecipitation totals and seasonal patterns.Much of the impacts \\nof climate change \\nwill be manifested \\nin the tropical zones \\nwhere most of the \\ndeveloping world can \\nbe foundExecutive Summary3Adaptation and mitigation\\nAdaptation and mitigation are complementary strategies for managing and reducing the risks of climate change.\\nAdaptation encompasses a combination of natural, engineered and technological options, as well as social and \\ninstitutional measures to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities from climate change. Adaptation \\noptions exist in all water-related sectors and should be investigated and applied where possible. \\nMitigation comprises human interventions to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases \\n(GHGs). While mitigation options are also available across every major water-related sector, they remain largely \\nunrecognized.\\nInternational policy frameworks\\nWithin the 2030 Agenda, water serves as an (often) unacknowledged but essential connecting factor for attaining \\nthe different Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As such, failure to adapt to climate change not only puts the \\nrealization of SDG 6 (the ‘water goal’) at risk, it also jeopardizes the achievement of most other SDGs. And while \\nSDG 13 “ Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts ” includes specific targets and indicators, \\nthere is no formal mechanism linking SDG 13 to the goals of the Paris Agreement, resulting in parallel processes.  \\nAlthough water is not mentioned in the Paris Agreement per se , it is an essential \\ncomponent of nearly all the mitigation and adaptation strategies. However, water is \\nidentified as the number one priority for adaptation actions in most of the intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) and is directly or indirectly related to all other priority areas. Similarly, water is hardly mentioned in the Sendai Framework \\nitself, even though water flows through each of the priorities for action and is central \\nto all its seven targets.\\nThe challenges of development, poverty eradication and sustainability are intricately \\ninterwoven with those of climate change mitigation and adaptation, especially \\nthrough water. Given water’s role in mitigating and adapting to climate change, water \\ncould play a connecting role across the SDGs and across policy frameworks such as \\nthe Paris Agreement.\\nWater resources management, infrastructure and ecosystems\\nClimate change generates additional risks to water-related infrastructure, requiring an ever-increasing need for adaptation measures. \\nWater-related extremes exacerbated by climate change increase risks to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) \\ninfrastructure, such as damaged sanitation systems or flooding of sewer pumping stations. The consequent \\nspread of faeces and associated protozoa and viruses can cause severe health hazards and cross-contamination.\\nFor water storage infrastructure, there is a need to reassess the safety and sustainability of dams, and to evaluate \\nthem for potential modifications or decommissioning, for the minimization of their environmental and social \\nimpacts, and for the optimization of their services.The challenges of \\ndevelopment, poverty \\neradication and \\nsustainability are \\nintricately interwoven \\nwith those of climate \\nchange mitigation \\nand adaptation, \\nespecially through \\nwaterThe United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 . Water and Climate Change4In many regions of the world, aquifers present the largest storage capacity, often orders of magnitude \\ngreater than surface water storage. Groundwater is also more buffered from seasonal and multi-year \\nclimate variability and less immediately vulnerable than surface water.\\nIt is increasingly necessary to consider ‘unconventional’ water resources in future planning. Water reuse (or \\nreclaimed water) is a reliable alternative to conventional water resources for a number of uses, provided \\nthat it is treated and/or used safely. Desalination can augment freshwater supplies, but it is generally \\nenergy-intensive and thus may contribute to GHG emissions if the power source is non-renewable. \\nAtmospheric moisture harvesting such as cloud seeding, or fog water collection presents a low-cost and \\nlow-maintenance approach for localized areas where advective fog is abundant.  \\nThe bulk of the GHG emissions related to water management and \\nsanitation either originates from the energy used to power the systems or \\nthe biochemical processes involved in water and wastewater treatment. \\nIncreasing water use efficiency and reducing unnecessary water \\nconsumption and water loss both translate into lower energy use and thus \\nlower GHG emissions.\\nWetlands accommodate the largest carbon stocks among terrestrial \\necosystems, storing twice as much carbon as forests. Taking into account \\nthat wetlands offer multiple co-benefits – including flood and drought \\nmitigation, water purification, and biodiversity – their restoration and \\nconservation is of critical importance.\\nDisaster risk reduction\\nThe current impacts and future anticipated risks associated with extreme events demand sustainable \\nsolutions for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction.\\nThe range of available climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies includes hard \\n(structural) and soft (policy instruments) approaches. Hard measures include enhanced water storage, \\nclimate-proof infrastructure, and crop resilience improvements through the introduction of flood- and \\ndrought-resistant crop varieties. Soft measures include flood and drought insurance, forecasting and early \\nwarning systems, land use planning, and capacity building (education and awareness). \\nHard and soft measures often go together. Urban planning, for example, can help increase resilience to \\nflood risks by featuring drainage systems that provide spaces to safely collect and store floodwater. The \\ncity thus acts as a ‘sponge’, limiting surges and releasing rainwater as a resource.\\nModern communication methods such as social media and mobile phone services provide significant \\nopportunities to help improve communication and early warning effectiveness. Drought and flood \\nmonitoring systems are also an important component of risk reduction.\\nMainstreaming gender and community involvement in decision-making processes are key elements to \\ndisaster risk reduction strategies. Improved inter-agency coordination in water resources and disaster risk \\nmanagement is needed, especially in transboundary basins where it remains fragmented throughout most \\nof the world.Water reuse  \\n(or reclaimed water)  \\nis a reliable alternative \\nto conventional \\nwater resources for \\na number of uses, \\nprovided that it is \\ntreated and/or used \\nsafelyExecutive Summary5Human health\\nAnticipated water-related health impacts of climate change are primarily food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, \\ndeaths and injury associated with extreme weather events such as coastal and inland flooding, as well as \\nundernutrition as a result or food shortages caused by droughts and floods. Mental health impacts associated \\nwith illness, injury, economic losses and displacement may also be substantial, although difficult to quantify.\\nAt the end of the Millennium Development Goals period (2000–2015), 91% of \\nthe global population used an improved drinking water source and 68% used \\nimproved sanitation facilities. Much remains to be done to reach the new, higher \\nlevels of safely managed water supply and sanitation services as defined under \\nthe SDGs for the 2.2 billion and 4.2 billion people respectively who lack this \\nsuperior level of service.\\nClimate change is likely to slow or undermine progress on access to safely \\nmanaged water and sanitation, and lead to ineffective use of resources if systems \\ndesign and management are not climate-resilient. By extension, progress on \\nthe elimination and control of water- and sanitation-related disease will also be \\nslowed or undermined by climate change.\\nFood and agriculture\\nThe specific challenges for agricultural water management are twofold. The first is the need to adapt existing \\nmodes of production to deal with higher incidences of water scarcity and water excess (flood protection and \\ndrainage). The second is to ‘decarbonize’ agriculture through climate mitigation measures that reduce GHG \\nemissions and enhance water availability.\\nThe scope for adaptation in rainfed agriculture is determined largely by the ability of crop varieties to cope with \\nshifts in temperature and to manage soil water deficits. Irrigation allows cropping calendars to be rescheduled \\nand intensified, thus providing a key adaptation mechanism for land that previously relied solely on precipitation.\\nIn terms of equivalent tonnes of CO2, the largest contribution to agricultural GHG emissions is made by the \\nrelease of livestock methane through enteric fermentation and manure deposited on pasture. For forestry, the \\ngreatest opportunity for mitigation involves reducing the emissions attributable to deforestation and forest \\ndegradation.\\nAgriculture has two main avenues for mitigation of GHGs: carbon sequestration through organic matter \\naccumulation above and below the ground, and emission reduction through land and water management, \\nincluding adoption of renewable energy inputs such as solar pumping. \\nClimate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) is a recognized suite of well-informed approaches to land and water \\nmanagement, soil conservation and agronomic practice that sequester carbon and reduce greenhouse gas \\nemissions. CSA practices help to retain soil structure, organic matter and moisture under drier conditions, and \\ninclude agronomic techniques (including irrigation and drainage) to adjust or extend cropping calendars to \\nadapt to seasonal and interannual climate shifts.Climate change \\nis likely to slow or \\nundermine progress \\non access to safely \\nmanaged water and \\nsanitationThe United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 . Water and Climate Change6Energy and industry\\nThe water-related effects of climate change generate risks to business and power generation. Water stress can \\nput a halt to manufacturing or energy generation. Impacts will also carry into operational aspects, affecting the \\nsupply of raw materials, disrupting supply chains, and causing damage to facilities and equipment.  \\nEnergy is in the spotlight of climate change initiatives as about two-thirds of the \\nworld’s anthropogenic GHGs come from energy production and use. There are \\na number of opportunities to mitigate GHGs and reduce water use at the same \\ntime. Reducing energy demand and increasing energy efficiency are starting \\npoints. One promising direction is the increased use of low-carbon renewable \\nenergy technology with little water requirements, such as solar photovoltaic (PV) \\nand wind, the costs of which are becoming increasingly competitive with fossil \\nfuel energy generation. While hydropower will continue playing a role in climate \\nmitigation and adaptation of the energy sector, the overall sustainability of single \\nprojects needs to be assessed, taking account of potential water consumption \\nthrough evaporation as well as GHG emissions from reservoirs, not to mention \\nthe potential ecological and socio-economic impacts. \\nFor business, water stress is one of the main drivers for water reuse and efficiency. In concert with technology, \\na facility could look at day-to-day operations such as the use of washwater, and better monitoring and leak \\ndetection. On an expanded scale, a company might evaluate its water footprint and include those of its suppliers, \\nwhich may have far-reaching effects if they are large water users.\\n \\nHuman settlements\\nThe impacts of climate change on urban water systems include higher temperatures, reduced precipitation and \\nmore severe drought on the one hand, and increasing heavy precipitation and flooding events on the other. It is \\nprecisely these extremes that make the planning of urban space and the provision of infrastructure so difficult.\\nThe physical infrastructure for delivery of water and sanitation facilities can also be disrupted, leading \\nto contaminated water supplies and the discharge of untreated wastewater and stormwater into living \\nenvironments. Vectorborne diseases such as malaria, rift valley fever, leptospirosis and others are often observed \\nafter flooding events.\\nUrban water resilience goes way beyond the traditional city boundaries. In cases where water supplies rely on \\ndistant watersheds, planning needs to look well beyond the city’s boundaries and consider the long-term impacts \\nof urban expansion on distant freshwater ecosystems and the local communities that also rely on them.\\nIn small urban and rural settlements, use of water for agriculture and in some cases industrial applications results \\nin reduced availability for domestic uses. Domestic supplies must be prioritized under the human rights to water \\nand sanitation.The water-related \\neffects of climate \\nchange generate \\nrisks to business and \\npower generationExecutive Summary7Nexus: Accounting for interlinkages\\nAdaptation and mitigation actions by one sector can directly influence its water demand, which can in turn \\naugment or reduce the local/regional water availability (including quality) for other sectors. In cases of reduced \\nwater demand, such actions can lead to multiple benefits across sectors and boundaries, whereas increased \\nwater demand can result in the need for trade-offs over the allocation of limited supplies.\\nWater use requires energy. Therefore, any reduction in water use has the potential to reduce the energy demand \\nfrom the water sector and thus help mitigate climate change (if said energy source is from fossil fuels). \\nConversely, energy production also requires water. With their very low water requirements, renewables such as \\nwind, solar PV and certain types of geothermal power generation are by far the best energy alternatives from a \\nwater demand perspective.\\nWater efficiency measures in agriculture can increase water availability and reduce the energy needed for \\npumping, in turn further reducing the water needed for energy production. Increased use of renewable energy in \\nagriculture (e.g. solar PV pumps) provide additional opportunities to lower GHG emissions and to support the \\nlivelihoods of smallholders. Since agriculture accounts for 69% of global water withdrawals, reducing food loss \\nand waste could also have significant repercussions on water and energy demand, and thereby reducing GHG \\nemissions.\\nConservation agriculture allows soils to retain more water, carbon and nutrients, with additional ecological benefits. \\nThe biomass and soils of properly managed forests, wetlands and grasslands provide mitigation opportunities \\nthrough carbon sequestration, with significant additional benefits in terms of nutrient cycling and biodiversity.\\nImproved approaches to the treatment of water, and especially wastewater, offer a range of mitigation \\nopportunities. Untreated wastewater is an important source of GHGs. With more than 80% of all wastewater \\n(globally) released to the environment without treatment, treating its organic matter prior to its release can \\nreduce GHG emissions. The reuse of untreated or partially treated wastewater can reduce the amount of energy \\nassociated with water extraction, advanced treatment and, in cases where the wastewater is reused at or near the \\nrelease site, transportation. The biogas produced from wastewater treatment processes can be recovered and \\nused to power the treatment plant itself, rendering it energy-neutral and further enhancing energy savings. \\nGovernance\\nBoth climate and water management require mechanisms for oversight and coordination. Sectoral fragmentation \\nand bureaucratic competition may pose serious challenges for the integration across scales. This calls for i) \\ngreater public participation to discuss and manage climate risk; ii) building adaptive capacities at multiple levels; \\nand iii) prioritizing risk reduction for socially vulnerable groups.\\n‘Good governance’ involves adhering to principles of human rights, including effectiveness, responsiveness \\nand accountability; openness and transparency; participation in the performance of key governance functions \\nrelating to policy and institutional arrangements; planning and coordination; and regulation and licensing. For \\nthe integration of substance, integrated water resources management (IWRM) provides a process to involve \\nstakeholders across society, the economy and the environment.\\nGreater public participation to manage climate risk is suggested as a way to build adaptive capacities at multiple \\nlevels, avoid institutional traps and prioritize risk reduction for socially vulnerable groups. At the same time, \\nscientific information and data also need to be made available at the local level and included as information into \\nlocal multi-stakeholder decision processes.The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 . Water and Climate Change8While governments remain responsible for leading national climate mitigation \\nand adaptation measures as well as water governance, the process of change is \\nalways coproduced. There are many indications that young people are increasingly \\nconcerned about climate change. Cities have also become forerunners of climate \\naction in many countries, and leading companies have made commitments to reduce \\ntheir water footprint and GHG emissions in order to address their contribution to \\nwater stress and climate change.\\nPoverty, discrimination and vulnerability are closely related and typically intersect. Women and girls from minority \\nethnic groups or from remote or disadvantaged areas may suffer multiple forms of exclusion and oppression. \\nWhen disasters hit, such inequalities can become exacerbated, making it more likely that poor people are affected. \\nPoor people are also likely to lose relatively more than the non-poor.\\nFinance\\nCurrent levels of financing are inadequate to reach the international community’s goal of universal availability and \\nsustainable management of water and sanitation. Proponents of water projects could aim to increase the water \\nsector’s share of climate finance and emphasize water’s ties to other climate-related sectors in order to ensure \\ngreater funding for water management.\\nTwo promising trends are generating opportunities for water projects to access climate finance. The first is \\nthe increasing recognition of the mitigation potential within water and sanitation projects. This trend could be \\nparticularly advantageous, as mitigation made up 93.8% of climate financing in 2016, but water projects consisted of \\na fraction of 1% of that sum. The second trend is an increasing emphasis on financing climate adaptation. \\nAccessing climate finance can be competitive and difficult, especially for complex water projects that may \\ntranscend national boundaries. Bankable climate projects are those that have a clearly articulated link to climate \\nchange impacts, familiarity and strict compliance with funding procedures, and sometimes additional funding \\nsources. In order to be considered bankable, projects hoping to use climate finance must explicitly address the \\ncauses and/or consequences of climate change. Projects that communicate and address risks, and capture co-\\nbenefits in other areas such as health, are also considered more bankable. \\nDifferentiated strategies that specifically consider the resilience needs of marginalized groups should also be built \\ninto larger water–climate plans and projects.\\nTechnological innovation\\nThe challenges, in terms of technological innovation, knowledge management, research and capacity development, \\nare to promote the generation of new tools and approaches through advanced research and development, and, \\nequally as important, to accelerate the implementation of existing knowledge and technologies across all countries \\nand regions. However, these actions will only lead to the intended outcomes if they are accompanied by awareness-\\nraising, as well as educational and capacity development programmes, in order to widely disseminate the available \\nknowledge and to stimulate the uptake of new and existing technologies.\\nSatellite-based earth observation can help identify trends in precipitation, evapotranspiration, snow and ice cover/\\nmelting, as well as runoff and storage, including groundwater levels. While remote sensing can reveal large-\\nscale processes and features that are not easily observable via traditional methods, the temporal and spatial \\nresolution may not be fully adequate for smaller-scale applications and data analysis. However, when backed with \\nnational statistics, field-based observations and numerical simulation models, remote sensing can contribute to a \\ncomprehensive assessment of climate change impacts related to water.There are many \\nindications that young \\npeople are increasingly \\nconcerned about \\nclimate changeExecutive Summary9Evolutions in the field of data acquisition have been facilitated by high-speed internet networks and global \\ncoverage, as well as cloud computing and the enhancement of virtual storage capabilities. Wireless sensors for \\nmonitoring water consumption have been developed and are increasingly used to allow for remote water metering. \\nApplications of big data analytics can help to obtain knowledge by processing the collection of continuous \\nstreams of water-related information and data, in order to extract actionable information and insights for improved \\nwater management. Citizen science and crowdsourcing have the potential to contribute to early warning systems \\nand to provide data for validating flood forecasting models. \\nRegional perspectives\\nDomestic regulation of water resources development, use, conservation and protection forms the foundational \\npillar of water governance and is the prime instrument for the implementation of INDCs under the Paris Agreement.\\nWhile two-thirds of countries outline a general portfolio of water projects in their INDCs, only one in ten cite what \\ncould be called a detailed project proposal, and these originate either from domestic water planning processes \\nor have emerged from previous climate funding proposals. However, the need for institutional reforms is well \\nrecognized in INDCs, often prioritized alongside infrastructure investments.\\nRegional approaches to support transformative shifts can play a critical role in national-level implementation by \\nimproving collaboration and coordination between responsible institutions; ensuring that action is based on sound \\ninformation and evidence; and increasing access to both public and private finance for climate-resilient investment.\\nSub-Saharan Africa\\nImpacts of climate variability on Africa’s water resources are already acute, as exemplified by the recent decrease \\nin rainfall in southern Africa. Water-related impacts of climate change on human health are also expected, through \\nvector- and waterborne diseases (including by further challenging access to safe drinking water, sanitation and \\nhygiene) and via malnutrition, given expected impacts on food security. In agricultural systems, especially in semi-\\narid areas, conventional livelihood-based approaches appear not robust enough to deal with the long-term impacts \\nof climate change.\\nPolicies and actions towards climate change adaptation and mitigation include: supporting resilience to \\ndroughts and floods through investing in and improving the climate resilience of WASH facilities; expanding \\nsocial protection and introducing financial products like insurance; enhancing gender equality in the use and \\nmanagement of water resources; and improving water availability for agriculture through water harvesting, \\nmulching and reduced tillage in rainfed systems.\\nEnergy is politically important to fulfil the ambitions of many African countries in terms of economic \\ntransformation. It could provide a catalyst to encourage regional cooperation to address challenges at the water–\\nenergy–climate nexus, possibly opening up investment in regional power pools and the institutional mechanisms \\nfor energy trading.\\nEurope, Caucasus and Central Asia\\nClimate projections indicate increasing precipitation in northern Europe and decreasing precipitation in southern \\nEurope. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights increasing challenges for irrigation, \\nhydropower, ecosystems and human settlements in the region.\\nThe key actions for more effective adaptation and more resilience to extremes in the region include: enhanced \\nwater efficiency and water saving strategies; monitoring and data sharing on water quantity and quality; improving \\ncoherence of climate change adaptation and water-related disaster risk reduction; and attracting funding from \\nmultiple sources (e.g. international, national and private).The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 . Water and Climate Change10In transboundary basins, technical and financial assistance can be shared up- or downstream, from wealthier to \\npoorer riparian countries. However, even where funds are available, transboundary water management can be \\npolitically difficult. This points to the need to find a politically salient entry point around which to build cooperation. \\nIn some cases, climate change itself can be the factor that opens up the opportunity for cooperation.\\nLatin America and the Caribbean\\nClimate variability and extreme events already severely affect the region. In Central and South America, observed \\nstreamflow and water availability changes are projected to continue, affecting vulnerable regions.\\nRapid urbanization, economic development and inequality are among the key socio-economic drivers of pressure \\non water systems with which climate impacts intersect. Poverty is persistent in most countries, contributing \\nto the vulnerability to climatic change. Economic inequality also translates into inequality in access to water \\nand sanitation, and vice versa. Increasing risks of waterborne diseases have a greater impact on poor people. \\nVulnerability is also high in rural areas, with climatic factors limiting economic options and driving out-migration.\\nFor many countries in the region, climate change occurs against a backdrop of high levels of intersectoral \\ncompetition for water, including between urban areas, the energy and agriculture sectors, and ecosystem needs.\\nThe limited explicit mention of transboundary water–climate issues in development strategies is symptomatic of \\nwider challenges in cooperation on transboundary waters in Latin America and the Caribbean.\\nAsia and the Pacific\\nThere is high variation and low confidence in projected water-related impacts of climate change at the subregional \\nscale in Asia and the Pacific. The region is highly vulnerable to climate-induced disasters and extreme weather \\nevents, which are disproportionately burdening poor and vulnerable groups. Water-related climate impacts \\nintersect with other socio-economic trends that impact water quality and quantity, including industrialization \\n(which is reshaping sectoral demand for water and increasing pollution), population growth and rapid urbanization. \\nThe latter have also increased exposure to water-related natural hazards such as floods.\\nClimate change and increasing demand for water will put additional stress on the region’s groundwater resources, \\nwhich are already experiencing severe stress in some areas due to increases in demand for irrigation.\\nAt the national level, identified priorities to accelerate water–climate action include: enhancing water governance \\nand water productivity to manage competition between the water needs of agriculture, energy, industry, cities and \\necosystems; promoting nature-based solutions that can curb emissions and increase resilience; and integrating \\nclimate change and disaster risk reduction across the entire project and policy cycle.\\nRegional cooperation on investment and information, as well as on institutional areas such as governance, \\ncapacity and partnerships, is urgently needed in Asia’s transboundary basins.\\nWestern Asia and North Africa\\nVulnerability to climate change is moderate to high across the region, with a generally increasing gradient \\nfrom north to south. Runoff and evapotranspiration generally follow the same trends as precipitation, although \\nevapotranspiration is limited by water scarcity.\\nThe areas with the highest vulnerability to climate change are in the Horn of Africa, the Sahel and the southwestern \\npart of the Arabian Peninsula, which comprise several of the region’s Least Developed Countries. While their \\nexposure to climate change varies, they all exhibit low adaptive capacity.Executive Summary11Intersecting with broad challenges of climate change and limited adaptive capacity are complex socio-economic \\nand political dynamics, affecting water at the regional, national and subnational levels. Politicization and \\nweaponization of water resources, displacement, and degradation of water infrastructure have been major \\nchallenges for countries affected by conflict. Inequalities in access to and control of water resources persist, \\nespecially across urban–rural and gender lines.\\nRegional stakeholders identified many priorities and opportunities relating to water, including: rendering urban \\ndevelopment more sustainable; enhancing data, research and innovation; increasing the resilience of vulnerable \\ncommunities exposed to floods and droughts, and threatened by food insecurity; furthering policy integration \\nbetween mitigation, adaptation and sustainable development; and increasing access to finance, including via \\ninternational climate funds and through the development of local markets and investment products. \\nThe way forward\\nGiven the cross-cutting nature of water and climate through different economic sectors and across society, trade-\\noffs and conflicting interests need to be addressed at all levels in order to negotiate integrated and coordinated \\nsolutions. This requires an equitable, participatory, multi-stakeholder approach to water governance in the context \\nof climate change.\\nThere are increasing opportunities to more genuinely and systematically integrate adaptation and mitigation \\nplanning into water investments, rendering these investments and associated activities more appealing to climate \\nfinanciers. Furthermore, various water-related climate change initiatives can also provide co-benefits such as job \\ncreation, improved public health, reduced poverty, the promotion of gender equality and enhanced livelihoods, \\namong others.\\nDespite the mounting evidence that climate change is affecting the global hydrological cycle, much uncertainty \\nremains when projecting its impacts over smaller geographical and temporal scales. However, this uncertainty \\nmust not be seen as an excuse for inaction. Rather, it should serve as an impetus to expand research, to promote \\nthe development of practical analytical tools and innovative technologies, to adopt no-regrets approaches, and to \\nbuild the institutional and human capacity required to foster informed, science-based decision-making.\\nThe need for greater cooperation between the water and climate communities exists well beyond the realm of \\nscientific research. On the one hand, it is imperative that the climate change community, and climate negotiators \\nin particular, give greater attention to the role of water and recognize its central importance in addressing the \\nclimate change crisis. On the other hand, it is equally (if not more) essential that the water community focuses \\nits\\xa0efforts to promote the importance of water in terms of both adaptation and mitigation, to develop concrete \\nwater-related project proposals for inclusion in NDCs, and to strengthen the means and capacities to plan, \\nimplement and monitor water-related activities in NDCs.\\nCombining climate change adaptation and mitigation, through water, is a win-win-win proposal. First, it benefits \\nwater resources management and improves the provision of water supply and sanitation services. Second, \\nit directly contributes to combating both the causes and impacts of climate change, including disaster risk \\nreduction. Third, it contributes, directly and indirectly, to meeting several of the Sustainable Development Goals \\n(hunger, poverty, health, energy, industry, climate action and so on – not to mention SDG 6, the ‘water goal’ itself) \\nand a host of other global objectives.\\nIn an era characterized by a host of ‘gloom and doom’ studies and articles on climate change and other global \\nenvironmental crises, this report proposes a series of practical responses, in terms of policy, financing and \\naction on the ground, to support our collective objectives and individual aspirations to achieve a sustainable and \\nprosperous world for all.Prepared by WWAP | Richard Connor\\nThis publication is produced by WWAP on behalf of UN-Water.\\nCover illustration by Davide Bonazzi\\nThe designations employed and the presentation of material throughout \\nthis publication do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of UNESCO concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.

by a factor of six over the past 100 years and continues to grow steadily at a \\nrate of about 1 per year as a result of increasing population economic development and shifting consumption \\npatterns Combined with a more erratic and uncertain supply climate change will aggravate the situation of \\ncurrently waterstressed regions and generate water stress in regions where water resources are still abundant \\ntoday Physical water scarcity is often a seasonal phenomenon rather than a chronic one and climate change is \\nlikely to cause shifts in seasonal water availability throughout the year in several places\\nClimate change manifests itself amongst others in the increasing frequency and magnitude of extreme events \\nsuch as heatwaves unprecedented rainfalls thunderstorms and storm surge events\\nWater quality will be adversely affected as a result of higher water temperatures reduced dissolved oxygen and \\nthus a reduced selfpurifying capacity of freshwater bodies There are further risks of water pollution and \\npathogenic contamination caused by flooding or by higher pollutant concentrations during drought\\nMany ecosystems particularly

regions of the world aquifers present the largest storage capacity often orders of magnitude \\ngreater than surface water storage Groundwater is also more buffered from seasonal and multiyear \\nclimate variability and less immediately vulnerable than surface water\\nIt is increasingly necessary to consider unconventional water resources in future planning Water reuse or \\nreclaimed water is a reliable alternative to conventional water resources for a number of uses provided \\nthat it is treated andor used safely Desalination can augment freshwater supplies but it is generally \\nenergyintensive and thus may contribute to GHG emissions if the power source is nonrenewable \\nAtmospheric moisture harvesting such as cloud seeding or fog water collection presents a lowcost and

forecasting and early \\nwarning systems land use planning and capacity building education and awareness \\nHard and soft measures often go together Urban planning for example can help increase resilience to \\nflood risks by featuring drainage systems that provide spaces to safely collect and store floodwater The \\ncity thus acts as a sponge limiting surges and releasing rainwater as a resource\\nModern communication methods such as social media and mobile phone services provide significant \\nopportunities to help improve communication and early warning effectiveness Drought and flood \\nmonitoring systems are also an important component of risk reduction\\nMainstreaming gender and community involvement in decisionmaking processes are key elements to \\ndisaster risk reduction strategies Improved interagency coordination in water resources and disaster risk \\nmanagement is needed especially in transboundary basins where it remains fragmented throughout most \\nof the worldWater reuse  \\nor reclaimed water  \\nis a reliable alternative \\nto conventional \\nwater resources for \\na number of uses \\nprovided that it is \\ntreated andor used \\nsafelyExecutive Summary5Human health\\nAnticipated waterrelated health impacts of climate change are primarily food water and vectorborne diseases \\ndeaths and injury associated with extreme weather events such as coastal and inland flooding as well as \\nundernutrition as a result or food shortages caused by droughts and floods Mental health impacts associated \\nwith illness injury economic losses and displacement may also be substantial although difficult to quantify\\nAt the end of the Millennium Development Goals period 20002015 91 of \\nthe global population used an improved drinking water source and 68 used \\nimproved sanitation facilities Much remains to be done to reach the new higher \\nlevels of safely managed water supply and sanitation services as defined under \\nthe SDGs for the 22 billion and 42 billion people respectively who lack this \\nsuperior level of service\\nClimate change is likely to slow or undermine progress on access to safely \\nmanaged water and sanitation and lead to ineffective use of resources if systems \\ndesign and management are not climateresilient By extension progress on \\nthe elimination and control of water and sanitationrelated disease will also be \\nslowed or undermined by climate change\\nFood and agriculture\\nThe specific challenges for agricultural water management are twofold The first is the need to adapt existing \\nmodes of production to deal with higher incidences of water scarcity and water excess flood protection and \\ndrainage The second is to decarbonize agriculture through climate mitigation measures that reduce GHG \\nemissions and enhance water availability\\nThe scope for adaptation in rainfed agriculture is determined largely by the ability of crop varieties to cope with \\nshifts in temperature and to manage soil water deficits Irrigation allows cropping calendars to be rescheduled \\nand intensified thus providing a key adaptation mechanism for land that previously relied solely on precipitation\\nIn terms of equivalent tonnes of CO2 the largest contribution to agricultural GHG emissions is made by the \\nrelease of livestock methane through enteric fermentation and manure deposited on pasture For forestry the \\ngreatest opportunity for mitigation involves reducing the emissions attributable to deforestation and forest \\ndegradation\\nAgriculture has two main avenues for mitigation of GHGs carbon sequestration through organic matter \\naccumulation above and below the ground and emission reduction through land and water management \\nincluding adoption of renewable energy inputs such as solar pumping \\nClimateSmart Agriculture CSA is a recognized suite of wellinformed approaches to land and water \\nmanagement soil conservation and agronomic practice that sequester carbon and reduce greenhouse gas \\nemissions CSA practices help to retain soil structure organic matter and moisture under drier conditions and \\ninclude agronomic techniques including irrigation and drainage to adjust or extend cropping calendars to \\nadapt to seasonal and interannual climate shiftsClimate change \\nis likely to slow or \\nundermine progress \\non access to safely \\nmanaged water and \\nsanitationThe United Nations World Water Development Report 2020  Water and Climate Change6Energy and industry\\nThe waterrelated effects of climate change generate risks to business and power generation Water stress can \\nput a halt to manufacturing or energy generation Impacts will also carry into operational aspects affecting the \\nsupply of raw materials disrupting supply chains and causing damage to facilities and equipment  \\nEnergy is in the spotlight of climate change initiatives as about twothirds of the \\nworlds anthropogenic GHGs come from energy production and use There are \\na number of opportunities to mitigate GHGs and reduce water use at the same \\ntime Reducing energy demand and increasing energy efficiency are starting \\npoints One promising direction is the increased use of lowcarbon renewable \\nenergy technology with little water requirements such as solar photovoltaic PV \\nand wind the costs of which are becoming increasingly competitive with fossil \\nfuel energy generation While hydropower will continue playing a role in climate \\nmitigation and adaptation of the energy sector the overall sustainability of single \\nprojects needs to be assessed taking account of potential water consumption \\nthrough evaporation as well as GHG emissions from reservoirs not to mention \\nthe potential ecological and socioeconomic impacts \\nFor business water stress is one of the main drivers for water reuse and efficiency In concert with technology \\na facility could look at daytoday operations such as the use of washwater and better monitoring and leak \\ndetection On an expanded scale a company might evaluate its water footprint and include those of its suppliers \\nwhich may have farreaching effects if they are large water users\\n \\nHuman settlements\\nThe impacts of climate change on urban water systems include higher temperatures reduced precipitation and \\nmore severe drought on the one hand and increasing heavy precipitation and flooding events on the other It is \\nprecisely these extremes that make the planning of urban space and the provision of infrastructure so difficult\\nThe physical infrastructure for delivery of water and sanitation facilities can also be disrupted leading \\nto contaminated water supplies and the discharge of untreated wastewater and stormwater into living \\nenvironments Vectorborne diseases such as malaria rift valley fever leptospirosis and others are often observed \\nafter flooding events\\nUrban water resilience goes way beyond the traditional city boundaries In cases where water supplies rely on \\ndistant watersheds planning needs to look well beyond the citys boundaries and consider the longterm impacts \\nof urban expansion on distant freshwater ecosystems and the local communities that also rely on them\\nIn small urban and rural settlements use of water for agriculture and in some cases industrial applications results \\nin reduced availability for domestic uses Domestic supplies must be prioritized under the human rights to water \\nand sanitationThe waterrelated \\neffects of climate \\nchange generate \\nrisks to business and \\npower generationExecutive Summary7Nexus Accounting for interlinkages\\nAdaptation and mitigation actions by one sector can directly influence its water demand which can in turn \\naugment or reduce the localregional water availability including quality for other sectors In cases of reduced \\nwater demand such actions can lead to multiple benefits across sectors and boundaries whereas increased \\nwater demand can result in the need for tradeoffs over the allocation of limited supplies\\nWater use requires energy Therefore any reduction in water use has the potential to reduce the energy demand \\nfrom the water sector and thus help mitigate climate change if said energy source is from fossil fuels \\nConversely energy production also requires water With their very low water requirements renewables such as \\nwind solar PV and certain types of geothermal power generation are by far the best energy alternatives from a \\nwater demand perspective\\nWater efficiency measures in agriculture can increase water availability and reduce the energy needed for \\npumping in turn further reducing the water needed for energy production Increased use of renewable energy in \\nagriculture eg solar PV pumps provide additional opportunities to lower GHG emissions and to support the \\nlivelihoods of smallholders Since agriculture accounts for 69 of global water withdrawals reducing food loss \\nand waste could also have significant repercussions on water and energy demand and thereby reducing GHG \\nemissions\\nConservation agriculture allows soils to retain more water carbon and nutrients with additional ecological benefits \\nThe biomass and soils of properly managed forests wetlands and grasslands provide mitigation opportunities \\nthrough carbon sequestration with significant additional benefits in terms of nutrient cycling and biodiversity\\nImproved approaches to the treatment of water and especially wastewater offer a range of mitigation \\nopportunities Untreated wastewater is an important source of GHGs With more than 80 of all wastewater \\nglobally released to the environment without treatment treating its organic matter prior to its release can \\nreduce GHG emissions The reuse of untreated or partially treated wastewater can reduce the amount of energy \\nassociated with water extraction advanced treatment and in cases where the wastewater is reused at or near the \\nrelease site transportation The biogas produced from wastewater treatment processes can be recovered and \\nused to power the treatment plant itself rendering it energyneutral and further enhancing energy savings \\nGovernance\\nBoth climate and water management require mechanisms for oversight and coordination Sectoral fragmentation \\nand bureaucratic competition may pose serious challenges for the integration across scales This calls for i \\ngreater public participation to discuss and manage climate risk ii building adaptive capacities at multiple levels \\nand iii prioritizing risk reduction for socially vulnerable groups\\nGood governance involves adhering to principles of human rights including effectiveness responsiveness \\nand accountability openness and transparency participation in the performance of key governance functions \\nrelating to policy and institutional arrangements planning and coordination and regulation and licensing For \\nthe integration of substance integrated water resources management IWRM provides a process to involve \\nstakeholders across society the economy and the environment\\nGreater public participation to manage climate risk is suggested as a way to build adaptive capacities at multiple \\nlevels avoid institutional traps and prioritize risk reduction for socially vulnerable groups At the same time \\nscientific information and data also need to be made available at the local level and included as information into \\nlocal multistakeholder decision processesThe United Nations World Water Development Report 2020  Water and Climate Change8While governments remain responsible for leading national climate mitigation \\nand adaptation measures as well as water governance the process of change is \\nalways coproduced There are many indications that young people are increasingly \\nconcerned about climate change Cities have also become forerunners of climate \\naction in many countries and leading companies have made commitments to reduce \\ntheir water footprint and GHG emissions in order to address their contribution to \\nwater stress and climate change\\nPoverty discrimination and vulnerability are closely related and typically intersect Women and girls from minority \\nethnic groups or from remote or disadvantaged areas may suffer multiple forms of exclusion and oppression \\nWhen disasters hit such inequalities can become exacerbated making it more likely that poor people are affected \\nPoor people are also likely to lose relatively more than the nonpoor\\nFinance\\nCurrent levels of financing are inadequate to reach the international communitys goal of universal availability and \\nsustainable management of water and sanitation Proponents of water projects could aim to increase the water \\nsectors share of climate finance and emphasize waters ties to other climaterelated sectors in order to ensure \\ngreater funding for water management\\nTwo promising trends are generating opportunities for water projects to access climate finance The first is \\nthe increasing recognition of the mitigation potential within water and sanitation projects This trend could be \\nparticularly advantageous as mitigation made up 938 of climate financing in 2016 but water projects consisted of \\na fraction of 1 of that sum The second trend is an increasing emphasis on financing climate adaptation \\nAccessing climate finance can be competitive and difficult especially for complex water projects that may \\ntranscend national boundaries Bankable climate projects are those that have a clearly articulated link to climate \\nchange impacts familiarity and strict compliance with funding procedures and sometimes additional funding \\nsources In order to be considered bankable projects hoping to use climate finance must explicitly address the \\ncauses andor consequences of climate change Projects that communicate and address risks and capture co\\nbenefits in other areas such as health are also considered more bankable \\nDifferentiated strategies that specifically consider the resilience needs of marginalized groups should also be built \\ninto larger waterclimate plans and projects\\nTechnological innovation\\nThe challenges in terms of technological innovation knowledge management research and capacity development \\nare to promote the generation of new tools and approaches through advanced research and development and \\nequally as important to accelerate the implementation of existing knowledge and technologies across all countries \\nand regions However these actions will only lead to the intended outcomes if they are accompanied by awareness\\nraising as well as educational and capacity development programmes in order to widely disseminate the available \\nknowledge and to stimulate the uptake of new and existing technologies\\nSatellitebased earth observation can help identify trends in precipitation evapotranspiration snow and ice cover\\nmelting as well as runoff and storage including groundwater levels While remote sensing can reveal large\\nscale processes and features that are not easily observable via traditional methods the temporal and spatial \\nresolution may not be fully adequate for smallerscale applications and data analysis However when backed with \\nnational statistics fieldbased observations and numerical simulation models remote sensing can contribute to a \\ncomprehensive assessment of climate change impacts related to waterThere are many \\nindications that young \\npeople are increasingly \\nconcerned about \\nclimate changeExecutive Summary9Evolutions in the field of data acquisition have been facilitated by highspeed internet networks and global \\ncoverage as well as cloud computing and the enhancement of virtual storage capabilities Wireless sensors for \\nmonitoring water consumption have been developed and are increasingly used to allow for remote water metering \\nApplications of big data analytics can help to obtain knowledge by processing the collection of continuous \\nstreams of waterrelated information and data in order to extract actionable information and insights for improved \\nwater management Citizen science and crowdsourcing have the potential to contribute to early warning systems \\nand to provide data for validating flood forecasting models \\nRegional perspectives\\nDomestic regulation of water resources development use conservation and protection forms the foundational \\npillar of water governance and is the prime instrument for the implementation of INDCs under the Paris Agreement\\nWhile twothirds of countries outline a general portfolio of water projects in their INDCs only one in ten cite what \\ncould be called a detailed project proposal and these originate either from domestic water planning processes \\nor have emerged from previous climate funding proposals However the need for institutional reforms is well \\nrecognized in INDCs often prioritized alongside infrastructure investments\\nRegional approaches to support transformative shifts can play a critical role in nationallevel implementation by \\nimproving collaboration and coordination between responsible institutions ensuring that action is based on sound \\ninformation and evidence and increasing access to both public and private finance for climateresilient investment\\nSubSaharan Africa\\nImpacts of climate variability on Africas water resources are already acute as exemplified by the recent decrease \\nin rainfall in southern Africa Waterrelated impacts of climate change on human health are also expected through \\nvector and waterborne diseases including by further challenging access to safe drinking water sanitation and \\nhygiene and via malnutrition given expected impacts on food security In agricultural systems especially in semi\\narid areas conventional livelihoodbased approaches appear not robust enough to deal with the longterm impacts \\nof climate change\\nPolicies and actions towards climate change adaptation and mitigation include supporting resilience to \\ndroughts and floods through investing in and improving the climate resilience of WASH facilities expanding \\nsocial protection and introducing financial products like insurance enhancing gender equality in the use and \\nmanagement of water resources and improving water availability for agriculture through water harvesting \\nmulching and reduced tillage in rainfed systems\\nEnergy is politically important to fulfil the ambitions of many African countries in terms of economic \\ntransformation It could provide a catalyst to encourage regional cooperation to address challenges at the water\\nenergyclimate nexus possibly opening up investment in regional power pools and the institutional mechanisms \\nfor energy trading\\nEurope Caucasus and Central Asia\\nClimate projections indicate increasing precipitation in northern Europe and decreasing precipitation in southern \\nEurope The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC highlights increasing challenges for irrigation \\nhydropower ecosystems and human settlements in the region\\nThe key actions for more effective adaptation and more resilience to extremes in the region include enhanced \\nwater efficiency and water saving strategies monitoring and data sharing on water quantity and quality improving \\ncoherence of climate change adaptation and waterrelated disaster risk reduction and attracting funding from \\nmultiple sources eg international national and privateThe United Nations World Water Development Report 2020  Water and Climate Change10In transboundary basins technical and financial assistance can be shared up or downstream from wealthier to \\npoorer riparian countries However even where funds are available transboundary water management can be \\npolitically difficult This points to the need to find a politically salient entry point around which to build cooperation \\nIn some cases climate change itself can be the factor that opens up the opportunity for cooperation\\nLatin America and the Caribbean\\nClimate variability and extreme events already severely affect the region In Central and South America observed \\nstreamflow and water availability changes are projected to continue affecting vulnerable regions\\nRapid urbanization economic development and inequality are among the key socioeconomic drivers of pressure \\non water systems with which climate impacts intersect Poverty is persistent in most countries contributing \\nto the vulnerability to climatic change Economic inequality also translates into inequality in access to water \\nand sanitation and vice versa Increasing risks of waterborne diseases have a greater impact on poor people \\nVulnerability is also high in rural areas with climatic factors limiting economic options and driving outmigration\\nFor many countries in the region climate change occurs against a backdrop of high levels of intersectoral \\ncompetition for water including between urban areas the energy and agriculture sectors and ecosystem needs\\nThe limited explicit mention of transboundary waterclimate issues in development strategies is symptomatic of \\nwider challenges in cooperation on transboundary waters in Latin America and the Caribbean\\nAsia and the Pacific\\nThere is high variation and low confidence in projected waterrelated impacts of climate change at the subregional \\nscale in Asia and the Pacific The region is highly vulnerable to climateinduced disasters and extreme weather \\nevents which are disproportionately burdening poor and vulnerable groups Waterrelated climate impacts \\nintersect with other socioeconomic trends that impact water quality and quantity including industrialization \\nwhich is reshaping sectoral demand for water and increasing pollution population growth and rapid urbanization \\nThe latter have also increased exposure to waterrelated natural hazards such as floods\\nClimate change and increasing demand for water will put additional stress on the regions groundwater resources \\nwhich are already experiencing severe stress in some areas due to increases in demand for irrigation\\nAt the national level identified priorities to accelerate waterclimate action include enhancing water governance \\nand water productivity to manage competition between the water needs of agriculture energy industry cities and \\necosystems promoting naturebased solutions that can curb emissions and increase resilience and integrating \\nclimate change and disaster risk reduction across the entire project and policy cycle\\nRegional cooperation on investment and information as well as on institutional areas such as governance \\ncapacity and partnerships is urgently needed in Asias transboundary basins\\nWestern Asia and North Africa\\nVulnerability to climate change is moderate to high across the region with a generally increasing gradient \\nfrom north to south Runoff and evapotranspiration generally follow the same trends as precipitation although \\nevapotranspiration is limited by water scarcity\\nThe areas with the highest vulnerability to climate change are in the Horn of Africa the Sahel and the southwestern \\npart of the Arabian Peninsula which comprise several of the regions Least Developed Countries While their \\nexposure to climate change varies they all exhibit low adaptive capacityExecutive Summary11Intersecting with broad challenges of climate change and limited adaptive capacity are complex socioeconomic \\nand political dynamics affecting water at the regional national and subnational levels Politicization and \\nweaponization of water resources displacement and degradation of water infrastructure have been major \\nchallenges for countries affected by conflict Inequalities in access to and control of water resources persist \\nespecially across urbanrural and gender lines\\nRegional stakeholders identified many priorities and opportunities relating to water including rendering urban \\ndevelopment more sustainable enhancing data research and innovation increasing the resilience of vulnerable \\ncommunities exposed to floods and droughts and threatened by food insecurity furthering policy integration \\nbetween mitigation adaptation and sustainable development and increasing access to finance including via \\ninternational climate funds and through the development of local markets and investment products \\nThe way forward\\nGiven the crosscutting nature of water and climate through different economic sectors and across society trade\\noffs and conflicting interests need to be addressed at all levels in order to negotiate integrated and coordinated \\nsolutions This requires an equitable participatory multistakeholder approach to water governance in the context \\nof climate change\\nThere are increasing opportunities to more genuinely and systematically integrate adaptation and mitigation \\nplanning into water investments rendering these investments and associated activities more appealing to climate \\nfinanciers Furthermore various waterrelated climate change initiatives can also provide cobenefits such as job \\ncreation improved public health reduced poverty the promotion of gender equality and enhanced livelihoods \\namong others\\nDespite the mounting evidence that climate change is affecting the global hydrological cycle much uncertainty \\nremains when projecting its impacts over smaller geographical and temporal scales However this uncertainty \\nmust not be seen as an excuse for inaction Rather it should serve as an impetus to expand research to promote \\nthe development of practical analytical tools and innovative technologies to adopt noregrets approaches and to \\nbuild the institutional and human capacity required to foster informed sciencebased decisionmaking\\nThe need for greater cooperation between the water and climate communities exists well beyond the realm of \\nscientific research On the one hand it is imperative that the climate change community and climate negotiators \\nin particular give greater attention to the role of water and recognize its central importance in addressing the \\nclimate change crisis On the other hand it is equally if not more essential that the water community focuses \\nits\\xa0efforts to promote the importance of water in terms of both adaptation and mitigation to develop concrete \\nwaterrelated project proposals for inclusion in NDCs and to strengthen the means and capacities to plan \\nimplement and monitor waterrelated activities in NDCs\\nCombining climate change adaptation and mitigation through water is a winwinwin proposal First it benefits \\nwater resources management and improves the provision of water supply and sanitation services Second \\nit directly contributes to combating both the causes and impacts of climate

2020  Water and Climate Change2Climate change will affect the availability quality and quantity of water for basic human needs threatening the \\neffective enjoyment of the human rights to water and

severe pressure in many regions of the world \\nFood security human health urban and rural settlements energy production industrial development economic \\ngrowth and ecosystems are all waterdependent

the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development the Paris Agreement on Climate Change \\nand the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction\\nImpacts on water resources\\nGlobal water use has increased by a factor of six over the past 100 years and continues to grow steadily at a \\nrate of about 1 per year as a result of increasing population economic development and shifting consumption \\npatterns Combined with a more erratic and uncertain supply climate change will aggravate the situation of \\ncurrently waterstressed regions and generate water stress in regions where water resources are still abundant \\ntoday Physical water scarcity is often a seasonal phenomenon rather than a chronic one and climate change is \\nlikely to cause shifts in seasonal water availability throughout the year in several places\\nClimate change manifests itself amongst others in the increasing frequency and magnitude of extreme events \\nsuch as heatwaves unprecedented rainfalls thunderstorms and storm surge events\\nWater quality will be adversely affected as a result of higher water temperatures reduced dissolved oxygen and \\nthus a reduced selfpurifying capacity of freshwater bodies There are further risks of water pollution and \\npathogenic contamination caused by flooding or by higher pollutant concentrations during drought\\nMany ecosystems particularly forests and wetlands are also at risk The \\ndegradation of ecosystems will not only lead to biodiversity loss but also affect the \\nprovision of waterrelated ecosystem services such as water purification carbon \\ncapture and storage and natural flood protection as well as the provision of water \\nfor agriculture fisheries and recreation\\nMuch of the impacts of climate change will be manifested in the tropical zones \\nwhere most of the developing world can be found Small island developing states \\nare typically environmentally and socioeconomically vulnerable to disasters and \\nclimate change and many will experience increasing water stress Across the planet \\ndrylands are expected to expand significantly Accelerated melting of glaciers is \\nexpected to have a negative effect on the water resources of mountain regions and \\ntheir adjacent lowlands\\nDespite the growing evidence that the changing climate will affect the availability and distribution of water \\nresources some uncertainties remain especially at local and basin scales While there is not much disagreement \\nabout the temperature increases which have been simulated by different general circulation models GCMs \\nunder specific scenario conditions more variability and ambiguity exist in projected precipitation trends Often \\ntrends in extremes heavier precipitation heat prolonged droughts show a clearer direction than trends in annual \\nprecipitation totals and seasonal patternsMuch of the impacts \\nof climate change \\nwill be manifested \\nin the tropical zones \\nwhere

change\\nAdaptation encompasses a combination of natural engineered and technological options as well as social and \\ninstitutional measures to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities from climate change Adaptation \\noptions exist in all waterrelated sectors and should be investigated and applied where possible \\nMitigation comprises human interventions to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases \\nGHGs While mitigation options are also available across every major waterrelated sector they remain largely \\nunrecognized\\nInternational policy

regions of the world aquifers present the largest storage capacity often orders of magnitude \\ngreater than surface water storage Groundwater is also more buffered from seasonal and multiyear \\nclimate variability and less immediately vulnerable than surface water\\nIt is increasingly necessary to consider unconventional water resources in future planning Water reuse or \\nreclaimed water

Summary5Human health\\nAnticipated waterrelated health impacts of climate change are primarily food water and vectorborne diseases \\ndeaths and injury associated with extreme weather events such as coastal and inland flooding as well as \\nundernutrition as a result or food shortages caused by droughts and floods Mental health impacts associated \\nwith illness injury economic losses and displacement may also be substantial although difficult to quantify\\nAt the end of the Millennium Development Goals period 20002015 91 of \\nthe global population used an improved drinking water source and 68 used \\nimproved sanitation facilities Much remains to be done to reach the new higher \\nlevels of safely managed water supply and sanitation services as defined under \\nthe SDGs for the 22 billion and 42 billion people respectively who lack this \\nsuperior level of service\\nClimate change is likely to slow or undermine progress on access to safely \\nmanaged water and sanitation and lead to ineffective use of resources if systems \\ndesign and management are not climateresilient By extension progress on \\nthe elimination and control of water and sanitationrelated disease will also be \\nslowed or undermined by climate change\\nFood and agriculture\\nThe specific challenges for agricultural water management are twofold The first is the need to adapt existing \\nmodes of production to deal with higher incidences of water scarcity and water excess flood protection and \\ndrainage The second is to decarbonize agriculture through climate mitigation measures that reduce GHG \\nemissions and enhance water availability\\nThe scope for adaptation in rainfed agriculture is determined largely by the ability of crop varieties to cope with \\nshifts in temperature and to manage soil water deficits Irrigation allows cropping calendars to be rescheduled \\nand intensified thus providing a key adaptation mechanism for land that previously relied solely on precipitation\\nIn terms of equivalent tonnes of CO2 the largest contribution to agricultural GHG emissions is made by the \\nrelease of livestock methane through enteric fermentation and manure deposited on pasture For forestry the \\ngreatest opportunity for mitigation involves reducing the emissions attributable to deforestation and forest \\ndegradation\\nAgriculture has two main avenues for mitigation of GHGs carbon sequestration through organic matter \\naccumulation above and below the ground and emission reduction through land and water management \\nincluding adoption of renewable energy inputs such as solar pumping \\nClimateSmart Agriculture CSA is a recognized suite of wellinformed approaches to land and water \\nmanagement soil conservation and agronomic practice that sequester carbon and reduce greenhouse gas \\nemissions CSA practices help to retain soil structure organic matter and moisture under drier conditions and \\ninclude agronomic techniques including irrigation and drainage to adjust or extend cropping calendars to \\nadapt to seasonal and interannual climate shiftsClimate change \\nis likely to slow or \\nundermine progress \\non access to safely \\nmanaged water and \\nsanitationThe United Nations World Water Development Report 2020  Water and Climate Change6Energy and industry\\nThe waterrelated effects of climate change generate risks to business and power generation Water stress can \\nput a halt to manufacturing or energy generation Impacts will also carry into operational aspects affecting the \\nsupply of raw materials disrupting supply chains and causing damage to facilities and equipment  \\nEnergy is in the spotlight of climate change initiatives as about twothirds of the \\nworlds anthropogenic GHGs come from energy production and use There are \\na number of opportunities to mitigate GHGs and reduce water use at the same \\ntime Reducing energy demand and increasing energy efficiency are starting \\npoints One promising direction is the increased use of lowcarbon renewable \\nenergy technology with little water requirements such as solar photovoltaic PV \\nand wind the costs of which are becoming increasingly competitive with fossil \\nfuel energy generation While hydropower will continue playing a role in climate \\nmitigation and adaptation of the energy sector the overall sustainability of single \\nprojects needs to be assessed taking account of potential water consumption \\nthrough evaporation as well as GHG emissions from reservoirs not to mention \\nthe potential ecological and socioeconomic impacts \\nFor business water stress is one of the main drivers for water reuse and efficiency In concert with technology \\na facility could look at daytoday operations such as the use of washwater and better monitoring and leak \\ndetection On an expanded scale a company might evaluate its water footprint and include those of its suppliers \\nwhich may have farreaching effects if they are large water users\\n \\nHuman settlements\\nThe impacts of climate change on urban water systems include higher temperatures reduced precipitation and \\nmore severe drought on the one hand and increasing heavy precipitation and flooding events on the other It is \\nprecisely these extremes that make the planning of urban space and the provision of infrastructure so difficult\\nThe physical infrastructure for delivery of water and sanitation facilities can also be disrupted leading \\nto contaminated water supplies and the discharge of untreated wastewater and stormwater into living \\nenvironments Vectorborne diseases such as malaria rift valley fever leptospirosis and others are often observed \\nafter flooding events\\nUrban water resilience goes way beyond the traditional city boundaries In cases where water supplies rely on \\ndistant watersheds planning needs to look well beyond the citys boundaries and consider the longterm impacts \\nof urban expansion on distant freshwater ecosystems and the local communities that also rely on them\\nIn small urban and rural settlements use of water for agriculture and in some cases industrial applications results \\nin reduced availability for domestic uses Domestic supplies must be prioritized under the human rights to water \\nand sanitationThe waterrelated \\neffects of climate \\nchange generate \\nrisks to business and \\npower generationExecutive Summary7Nexus Accounting for interlinkages\\nAdaptation and mitigation actions by one sector can directly influence its water demand which can in turn \\naugment or reduce the localregional water availability including quality for other sectors In cases of reduced \\nwater demand such actions can lead to multiple benefits across sectors and boundaries whereas increased \\nwater demand can result in the need for tradeoffs over the allocation of limited supplies\\nWater use requires energy Therefore any reduction in water use has the potential to reduce the energy demand \\nfrom the water sector and thus help mitigate climate change if said energy source is from fossil fuels \\nConversely energy production also requires water With their very low water requirements renewables such as \\nwind solar PV and certain types of geothermal power generation are by far the best energy alternatives from a \\nwater demand perspective\\nWater efficiency measures in agriculture can increase water availability and reduce the energy needed for \\npumping in turn further reducing the water needed for energy production Increased use of renewable energy in \\nagriculture eg solar PV pumps provide additional opportunities to lower GHG emissions and to support the \\nlivelihoods of smallholders Since agriculture accounts for 69 of global water withdrawals reducing food loss \\nand waste could also have significant repercussions on water and energy demand and thereby reducing GHG \\nemissions\\nConservation agriculture allows soils to retain more water carbon and nutrients with additional ecological benefits \\nThe biomass and soils of properly managed forests wetlands and grasslands provide mitigation opportunities \\nthrough carbon sequestration with significant additional benefits in terms of nutrient cycling and biodiversity\\nImproved approaches to the treatment of water and especially wastewater offer a range of mitigation \\nopportunities Untreated wastewater is an important source of GHGs With more than 80 of all wastewater \\nglobally released to the environment without treatment treating its organic matter prior to its release can \\nreduce GHG emissions The reuse of untreated or partially treated wastewater can reduce the amount of energy \\nassociated with water extraction advanced treatment and in cases where the wastewater is reused at or near the \\nrelease site transportation The biogas produced from wastewater treatment processes can be recovered and \\nused to power the treatment plant itself rendering it energyneutral and further enhancing energy savings \\nGovernance\\nBoth climate and water management require mechanisms for oversight and coordination Sectoral fragmentation \\nand bureaucratic competition may pose serious challenges for the integration across scales This calls for i \\ngreater public participation to discuss and manage climate risk ii building adaptive capacities at multiple levels \\nand iii prioritizing risk reduction for socially vulnerable groups\\nGood governance involves adhering to principles of human rights including effectiveness responsiveness \\nand accountability openness and transparency participation in the performance of key governance functions \\nrelating to policy and institutional arrangements planning and coordination and regulation and licensing For \\nthe integration of substance integrated water resources management IWRM provides a process to involve \\nstakeholders across society the economy and the environment\\nGreater public participation to manage climate risk is suggested as a way to build adaptive capacities at multiple \\nlevels avoid institutional traps and prioritize risk reduction for socially vulnerable groups At the same time \\nscientific information and data also need to be made available at the local level and included as information into \\nlocal multistakeholder decision processesThe United Nations World Water Development Report 2020  Water and Climate Change8While governments remain responsible for leading national climate mitigation \\nand adaptation measures as well as water governance the process of change is \\nalways coproduced There are many indications that young people are increasingly \\nconcerned about climate change Cities have also become forerunners of climate \\naction in many countries and leading companies have made commitments to reduce \\ntheir water footprint and GHG emissions in order to address their contribution to \\nwater stress and climate change\\nPoverty discrimination and vulnerability are closely related and typically intersect Women and girls from minority \\nethnic groups or from remote or disadvantaged areas may suffer multiple forms of exclusion and oppression \\nWhen disasters hit such inequalities can become exacerbated making it more likely that poor people are affected \\nPoor people are also likely to lose relatively more than the nonpoor\\nFinance\\nCurrent levels of financing are inadequate to reach the international communitys goal of universal availability and \\nsustainable management of water and sanitation Proponents of water projects could aim to increase the water \\nsectors share of climate finance and emphasize waters ties to other climaterelated sectors in order to ensure \\ngreater funding for water management\\nTwo promising trends are generating opportunities for water projects to access climate finance The first is \\nthe increasing recognition of the mitigation potential within water and sanitation projects This trend could be \\nparticularly advantageous as mitigation made up 938 of climate financing in 2016 but water projects consisted of \\na fraction of 1 of that sum The second trend is an increasing emphasis on financing climate adaptation \\nAccessing climate finance can be competitive and difficult especially for complex water projects that may \\ntranscend national boundaries Bankable climate projects are those that have a clearly articulated link to climate \\nchange impacts familiarity and strict compliance with funding procedures and sometimes additional funding \\nsources In order to be considered bankable projects hoping to use climate finance must explicitly address the \\ncauses andor consequences of climate change Projects that communicate and address risks and capture co\\nbenefits in other areas such as health are also considered more bankable \\nDifferentiated strategies that specifically consider the resilience needs of marginalized groups should also be built \\ninto larger waterclimate plans and projects\\nTechnological innovation\\nThe challenges in terms of technological innovation knowledge management research and capacity development \\nare to promote the generation of new tools and approaches through advanced research and development and \\nequally as important to accelerate the implementation of existing knowledge and technologies across all countries \\nand regions However these actions will only lead to the intended outcomes if they are accompanied by awareness\\nraising as well as educational and capacity development programmes in order to widely disseminate the available \\nknowledge and to stimulate the uptake of new and existing technologies\\nSatellitebased earth observation can help identify trends in precipitation evapotranspiration snow and ice cover\\nmelting as well as runoff and storage including groundwater levels While remote sensing can reveal large\\nscale processes and features that are not easily observable via traditional methods the temporal and spatial \\nresolution may not be fully adequate for smallerscale applications and data analysis However when backed with \\nnational statistics fieldbased observations and numerical simulation models remote sensing can contribute to a \\ncomprehensive assessment of climate change impacts related to waterThere are many \\nindications that young \\npeople are increasingly \\nconcerned about \\nclimate changeExecutive Summary9Evolutions in the field of data acquisition have been facilitated by highspeed internet networks and global \\ncoverage as well as cloud computing and the enhancement of virtual storage capabilities Wireless sensors for \\nmonitoring water consumption have been developed and are increasingly used to allow for remote water metering \\nApplications of big data analytics can help to obtain knowledge by processing the collection of continuous \\nstreams of waterrelated information and data in order to extract actionable information and insights for improved \\nwater management Citizen science and crowdsourcing have the potential to contribute to early warning systems \\nand to provide data for validating flood forecasting models \\nRegional perspectives\\nDomestic regulation of water resources development use conservation and protection forms the foundational \\npillar of water governance and is the prime instrument for the implementation of INDCs under the Paris Agreement\\nWhile twothirds of countries outline a general portfolio of water projects in their INDCs only one in ten cite what \\ncould be called a detailed project proposal and these originate either from domestic water planning processes \\nor have emerged from previous climate funding proposals However the need for institutional reforms is well \\nrecognized in INDCs often prioritized alongside infrastructure investments\\nRegional approaches to support transformative shifts can play a critical role in nationallevel implementation by \\nimproving collaboration and coordination between responsible institutions ensuring that action is based on sound \\ninformation and evidence and increasing access to both public and private finance for climateresilient investment\\nSubSaharan Africa\\nImpacts of climate variability on Africas water resources are already acute as exemplified by the recent decrease \\nin rainfall in southern Africa Waterrelated impacts of climate change on human health are also expected through \\nvector and waterborne diseases including by further challenging access to safe drinking water sanitation and \\nhygiene and via malnutrition given expected impacts on food security In agricultural systems especially in semi\\narid areas conventional livelihoodbased approaches appear not robust enough to deal with the longterm impacts \\nof climate change\\nPolicies and actions towards climate change adaptation and mitigation include supporting resilience to \\ndroughts and floods through investing in and improving the climate resilience of WASH facilities expanding \\nsocial protection and introducing financial products like insurance enhancing gender equality in the use and \\nmanagement of water resources and improving water availability for agriculture through water harvesting \\nmulching and reduced tillage in rainfed systems\\nEnergy is politically important to fulfil the ambitions of many African countries in terms of economic \\ntransformation It could provide a catalyst to encourage regional cooperation to address challenges at the water\\nenergyclimate nexus possibly opening up investment in regional power pools and the institutional mechanisms \\nfor energy trading\\nEurope Caucasus and Central Asia\\nClimate projections indicate increasing precipitation in northern Europe and decreasing precipitation in southern \\nEurope The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC highlights increasing challenges for irrigation \\nhydropower ecosystems and human settlements in the region\\nThe key actions for more effective adaptation and more resilience to extremes in the region include enhanced \\nwater efficiency and water saving strategies monitoring and data sharing on water quantity and quality improving \\ncoherence of climate change adaptation and waterrelated disaster risk reduction and attracting funding from \\nmultiple sources eg international national and privateThe United Nations World Water Development Report 2020  Water and Climate Change10In transboundary basins technical and financial assistance can be shared up or downstream from wealthier to \\npoorer riparian countries However even where funds are available transboundary water management can be \\npolitically difficult This points to the need to find a politically salient entry point around which to build cooperation \\nIn some cases climate change itself can be the factor that opens up the opportunity for cooperation\\nLatin America and the Caribbean\\nClimate variability and extreme events already severely affect the region In Central and South America observed \\nstreamflow and water availability changes are projected to continue affecting vulnerable regions\\nRapid urbanization economic development and inequality are among the key socioeconomic drivers of pressure \\non water systems with which climate impacts intersect Poverty is persistent in most countries contributing \\nto the vulnerability to climatic change Economic inequality also translates into inequality in access to water \\nand sanitation and vice versa Increasing risks of waterborne diseases have a greater impact on poor people \\nVulnerability is also high in rural areas with climatic factors limiting economic options and driving outmigration\\nFor many countries in the region climate change occurs against a backdrop of high levels of intersectoral \\ncompetition for water including between urban areas the energy and agriculture sectors and ecosystem needs\\nThe limited explicit mention of transboundary waterclimate issues in development strategies is symptomatic of \\nwider challenges in cooperation on transboundary waters in Latin America and the Caribbean\\nAsia and the Pacific\\nThere is high variation and low confidence in projected waterrelated impacts of climate change at the subregional \\nscale in Asia and the Pacific The region is highly vulnerable to climateinduced disasters and extreme weather \\nevents which are disproportionately burdening poor and vulnerable groups Waterrelated climate impacts \\nintersect with other socioeconomic trends that impact water quality and quantity including industrialization \\nwhich is reshaping sectoral demand for water and increasing pollution population growth and rapid urbanization \\nThe latter have also increased exposure to waterrelated natural hazards such as floods\\nClimate change and increasing demand for water will put additional stress on the regions groundwater resources \\nwhich are already experiencing severe stress in some areas due to increases in demand for irrigation\\nAt the national level identified priorities to accelerate waterclimate action include enhancing water governance \\nand water productivity to manage competition between the water needs of agriculture energy industry cities and \\necosystems promoting naturebased solutions that can curb emissions and increase resilience and integrating \\nclimate change and disaster risk reduction across the entire project and policy cycle\\nRegional cooperation on investment and information as well as on institutional areas such as governance \\ncapacity and partnerships is urgently needed in Asias transboundary basins\\nWestern Asia and North Africa\\nVulnerability to climate change is moderate to high across the region with a generally increasing gradient \\nfrom north to south Runoff and evapotranspiration generally follow the same trends as precipitation although \\nevapotranspiration is limited by water scarcity\\nThe areas with the highest vulnerability to climate change are in the Horn of Africa the Sahel and the southwestern \\npart of the Arabian Peninsula which comprise several of the regions Least Developed Countries While their \\nexposure to climate change varies they all exhibit low adaptive capacityExecutive Summary11Intersecting with broad challenges of climate change and limited adaptive capacity are complex socioeconomic \\nand political dynamics affecting water at the regional national and subnational levels Politicization and \\nweaponization of water resources displacement and degradation of water infrastructure have been major \\nchallenges for countries affected by conflict Inequalities in access to and control of water resources persist \\nespecially across urbanrural and gender lines\\nRegional stakeholders identified many priorities and opportunities relating to water including rendering urban \\ndevelopment more sustainable enhancing data research and innovation increasing the resilience of vulnerable \\ncommunities exposed to floods and droughts and threatened by food insecurity furthering policy integration \\nbetween mitigation adaptation and sustainable development and increasing access to finance including via \\ninternational climate funds and through the development of local markets and investment products \\nThe way forward\\nGiven the crosscutting nature of water and climate through different economic sectors and across society trade\\noffs and conflicting interests need to be addressed at all levels in order to negotiate integrated and coordinated \\nsolutions This requires an equitable participatory multistakeholder approach to water governance in the context \\nof climate change\\nThere are increasing opportunities to more genuinely and systematically integrate adaptation and mitigation \\nplanning into water investments rendering these investments and associated activities more appealing to climate \\nfinanciers Furthermore various waterrelated climate change initiatives can also provide cobenefits such as job \\ncreation improved public health reduced poverty the promotion of gender equality and enhanced livelihoods \\namong others\\nDespite the mounting evidence that climate change is affecting the global hydrological cycle much uncertainty \\nremains when projecting its impacts over smaller geographical and temporal scales However this uncertainty \\nmust not be seen as an excuse for inaction Rather it should serve as an impetus to expand research to promote \\nthe development of practical analytical tools and innovative technologies to adopt noregrets approaches and to \\nbuild the institutional and human capacity required to foster informed sciencebased decisionmaking\\nThe need for greater cooperation between the water and climate communities exists well beyond the realm of \\nscientific research On the one hand it is imperative that the climate change community and climate negotiators \\nin particular give greater attention to the role of water and recognize its central importance in addressing the \\nclimate change crisis On the other hand it is equally if not more essential that the water community focuses \\nits\\xa0efforts to promote the importance of water in terms of both adaptation and mitigation to develop concrete \\nwaterrelated project proposals for inclusion in NDCs and to strengthen the means and capacities to plan \\nimplement and monitor waterrelated activities in NDCs\\nCombining climate change adaptation and mitigation through water is a winwinwin proposal First it benefits \\nwater resources management and improves the provision of water supply and sanitation services Second \\nit directly contributes to combating both the causes and impacts of climate change including disaster risk \\nreduction Third it contributes directly and indirectly to meeting several of the Sustainable Development Goals \\nhunger poverty health energy industry climate action and so on  not to mention SDG 6 the water goal itself \\nand a host of other global objectives\\nIn an era characterized by a host of gloom and doom studies and articles on climate change and other global \\nenvironmental crises this report proposes a series of practical responses in terms of policy financing and \\naction on the ground to support our collective objectives and individual
