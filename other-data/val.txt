r water including between urban areas the energy and agriculture sectors and ecosystem needs
The limited explicit mention of transboundary waterclimate issues in development strategies is symptomatic of 
wider challenges in cooperation on transboundary waters in Latin America and the Caribbean
Asia and the Pacific
There is high variation and low confidence in projected waterrelated impacts of climate change at the subregional 
scale in Asia and the Pacific The region is highly vulnerable to climateinduced disasters and extreme weather 
events which are disproportionately burdening poor and vulnerable groups Waterrelated climate impacts 
intersect with other socioeconomic trends that impact water quality and quantity including industrialization 
which is reshaping sectoral demand for water and increasing pollution population growth and rapid urbanization 
The latter have also increased exposure to waterrelated natural hazards such as floods
Climate change and increasing demand for water will put additional stress on the regions groundwater resources 
which are already experiencing severe stress in some areas due to increases in demand for irrigation
At the national level identified priorities to accelerate waterclimate action include enhancing water governance 
and water productivity to manage competition between the water needs of agriculture energy industry cities and 
ecosystems promoting naturebased solutions that can curb emissions and increase resilience and integrating 
climate change and disaster risk reduction across the entire project and policy cycle
Regional cooperation on investment and information as well as on institutional areas such as governance 
capacity and partnerships is urgently needed in Asias transboundary basins
Western Asia and North Africa
Vulnerability to climate change is moderate to high across the region with a generally increasing gradient 
from north to south Runoff and evapotranspiration generally follow the same trends as precipitation although 
evapotranspiration is limited by water scarcity
The areas with the highest vulnerability to climate change are in the Horn of Africa the Sahel and the southwestern 
part of the Arabian Peninsula which comprise several of the regions Least Developed Countries While their 
exposure to climate change varies they all exhibit low adaptive capacityExecutive Summary11Intersecting with broad challenges of climate change and limited adaptive capacity are complex socioeconomic 
and political dynamics affecting water at the regional national and subnational levels Politicization and 
weaponization of water resources displacement and degradation of water infrastructure have been major 
challenges for countries affected by conflict Inequalities in access to and control of water resources persist 
especially across urbanrural and gender lines
Regional stakeholders identified many priorities and opportunities relating to water including rendering urban 
development more sustainable enhancing data research and innovation increasing the resilience of vulnerable 
communities exposed to floods and droughts and threatened by food insecurity furthering policy integration 
between mitigation adaptation and sustainable development and increasing access to finance including via 
international climate funds and through the development of local markets and investment products 
The way forward
Given the crosscutting nature of water and climate through different economic sectors and across society trade
offs and conflicting interests need to be addressed at all levels in order to negotiate integrated and coordinated 
solutions This requires an equitable participatory multistakeholder approach to water governance in the context 
of climate change
There are increasing opportunities to more genuinely and systematically integrate adaptation and mitigation 
planning into water investments rendering these investments and associated activities more appealing to climate 
financiers Furthermore various waterrelated climate change initiatives can also provide cobenefits such as job 
creation improved public health reduced poverty the promotion of gender equality and enhanced livelihoods 
among others
Despite the mounting evidence that climate change is affecting the global hydrological cycle much uncertainty 
remains when projecting its impacts over smaller geographical and temporal scales However this uncertainty 
must not be seen as an excuse for inaction Rather it should serve as an impetus to expand research to promote 
the development of practical analytical tools and innovative technologies to adopt noregrets approaches and to 
build the institutional and human capacity required to foster informed sciencebased decisionmaking
The need for greater cooperation between the water and climate communities exists well beyond the realm of 
scientific research On the one hand it is imperative that the climate change community and climate negotiators 
in particular give greater attention to the role of water and recognize its central importance in addressing the 
climate change crisis On the other hand it is equally if not more essential that the water community focuses 
itsÂ efforts to promote the importance of water in terms of both adaptation and mitigation to develop concrete 
waterrelated project proposals for inclusion in NDCs and to strengthen the means and capacities to plan 
implement and monitor waterrelated activities in NDCs
Combining climate change adaptation and mitigation through water is a winwinwin proposal First it benefits 
water resources management and improves the provision of water supply and sanitation services Second 
it directly contributes to combating both the causes and impacts of climate change including disaster risk 
reduction Third it contributes directly and indirectly to meeting several of the Sustainable Development Goals 
hunger poverty health energy industry climate action and so on  not to mention SDG 6 the water goal itself 
and a host of other global objectives
In an era characterized by a host of gloom and doom studies and articles on climate change and other global 
environmental crises this report proposes a series of practical responses in terms of policy financing and 
action on the ground to support our collective objectives and individual aspirations to achieve a sustainable and 
prosperous world for allPrepared by WWAP  Richard Connor
