Educational Scientic and
Cultural OrganizationThe United Nations World Water Development Report 2020  Water and Climate Change2Climate change will affect the availability quality and quantity of water for basic human needs threatening the 
effective enjoyment of the human rights to water and sanitation for potentially billions of people The hydrological 
changes induced by climate change will add challenges to the sustainable management of water resources which 
are already under severe pressure in many regions of the world 
Food security human health urban and rural settlements energy production industrial development economic 
growth and ecosystems are all waterdependent and thus vulnerable to the impacts of climate change Climate 
change adaptation and mitigation through water management is therefore critical to sustainable development 
and essential to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development the Paris Agreement on Climate Change 
and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction
Impacts on water resources
Global water use has increased by a factor of six over the past 100 years and continues to grow steadily at a 
rate of about 1 per year as a result of increasing population economic development and shifting consumption 
patterns Combined with a more erratic and uncertain supply climate change will aggravate the situation of 
currently waterstressed regions and generate water stress in regions where water resources are still abundant 
today Physical water scarcity is often a seasonal phenomenon rather than a chronic one and climate change is 
likely to cause shifts in seasonal water availability throughout the year in several places
Climate change manifests itself amongst others in the increasing frequency and magnitude of extreme events 
such as heatwaves unprecedented rainfalls thunderstorms and storm surge events
Water quality will be adversely affected as a result of higher water temperatures reduced dissolved oxygen and 
thus a reduced selfpurifying capacity of freshwater bodies There are further risks of water pollution and 
pathogenic contamination caused by flooding or by higher pollutant concentrations during drought
Many ecosystems particularly forests and wetlands are also at risk The 
degradation of ecosystems will not only lead to biodiversity loss but also affect the 
provision of waterrelated ecosystem services such as water purification carbon 
capture and storage and natural flood protection as well as the provision of water 
for agriculture fisheries and recreation
Much of the impacts of climate change will be manifested in the tropical zones 
where most of the developing world can be found Small island developing states 
are typically environmentally and socioeconomically vulnerable to disasters and 
climate change and many will experience increasing water stress Across the planet 
drylands are expected to expand significantly Accelerated melting of glaciers is 
expected to have a negative effect on the water resources of mountain regions and 
their adjacent lowlands
Despite the growing evidence that the changing climate will affect the availability and distribution of water 
resources some uncertainties remain especially at local and basin scales While there is not much disagreement 
about the temperature increases which have been simulated by different general circulation models GCMs 
under specific scenario conditions more variability and ambiguity exist in projected precipitation trends Often 
trends in extremes heavier precipitation heat prolonged droughts show a clearer direction than trends in annual 
precipitation totals and seasonal patternsMuch of the impacts 
of climate change 
will be manifested 
in the tropical zones 
where most of the 
developing world can 
be foundExecutive Summary3Adaptation and mitigation
Adaptation and mitigation are complementary strategies for managing and reducing the risks of climate change
Adaptation encompasses a combination of natural engineered and technological options as well as social and 
institutional measures to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities from climate change Adaptation 
options exist in all waterrelated sectors and should be investigated and applied where possible 
Mitigation comprises human interventions to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases 
GHGs While mitigation options are also available across every major waterrelated sector they remain largely 
unrecognized
International policy frameworks
Within the 2030 Agenda water serves as an often unacknowledged but essential connecting factor for attaining 
the different Sustainable Development Goals SDGs As such failure to adapt to climate change not only puts the 
realization of SDG 6 the water goal at risk it also jeopardizes the achievement of most other SDGs And while 
SDG 13  Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts  includes specific targets and indicators 
there is no formal mechanism linking SDG 13 to the goals of the Paris Agreement resulting in parallel processes  
Although water is not mentioned in the Paris Agreement per se  it is an essential 
component of nearly all the mitigation and adaptation strategies However water is 
identified as the number one priority for adaptation actions in most of the intended nationally determined contributions INDCs and is directly or indirectly related to all other priority areas Similarly water is hardly mentioned in the Sendai Framework 
itself even though water flows through each of the priorities for action and is central 
to all its seven targets
The challenges of development poverty eradication and sustainability are intricately 
interwoven with those of climate change mitigation and adaptation especially 
through water Given waters role in mitigating and adapting to climate change water 
could play a connecting role across the SDGs and across policy frameworks such as 
the Paris Agreement
Water resources management infrastructure and ecosystems
Climate change generates additional risks to waterrelated infrastructure requiring an everincreasing need for adaptation measures 
Waterrelated extremes exacerbated by climate change increase risks to water sanitation and hygiene WASH 
infrastructure such as damaged sanitation systems or flooding of sewer pumping stations The consequent 
spread of faeces and associated protozoa and viruses can cause severe health hazards and crosscontamination
For water storage infrastructure there is a need to reassess the safety and sustainability of dams and to evaluate 
them for potential modifications or decommissioning for the minimization of their environmental and social 
impacts and for the optimization of their servicesThe challenges of 
development poverty 
eradication and 
sustainability are 
intricately interwoven 
with those of climate 
change mitigation 
and adaptation 
especially through 
waterThe United Nations World Water Development Report 2020  Water and Climate Change4In many regions of the world aquifers present the largest storage capacity often orders of magnitude 
greater than surface water storage Groundwater is also more buffered from seasonal and multiyear 
climate variability and less immediately vulnerable than surface water
It is increasingly necessary to consider unconventional water resources in future planning Water reuse or 
reclaimed water is a reliable alternative to conventional water resources for a number of uses provided 
that it is treated andor used safely Desalination can augment freshwater supplies but it is generally 
energyintensive and thus may contribute to GHG emissions if the power source is nonrenewable 
Atmospheric moisture harvesting such as cloud seeding or fog water collection presents a lowcost and 
lowmaintenance approach for localized areas where advective fog is abundant  
The bulk of the GHG emissions related to water management and 
sanitation either originates from the energy used to power the systems or 
the biochemical processes involved in water and wastewater treatment 
Increasing water use efficiency and reducing unnecessary water 
consumption and water loss both translate into lower energy use and thus 
lower GHG emissions
Wetlands accommodate the largest carbon stocks among terrestrial 
ecosystems storing twice as much carbon as forests Taking into account 
that wetlands offer multiple cobenefits  including flood and drought 
mitigation water purification and biodiversity  their restoration and 
conservation is of critical importance
Disaster risk reduction
The current impacts and future anticipated risks associated with extreme events demand sustainable 
solutions for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction
The range of available climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies includes hard 
structural and soft policy instruments approaches Hard measures include enhanced water storage 
climateproof infrastructure and crop resilience improvements through the introduction of flood and 
droughtresistant crop varieties Soft measures include flood and drought insurance forecasting and early 
warning systems land use planning and capacity building education and awareness 
Hard and soft measures often go together Urban planning for example can help increase resilience to 
flood risks by featuring drainage systems that provide spaces to safely collect and store floodwater The 
city thus acts as a sponge limiting surges and releasing rainwater as a resource
Modern communication methods such as social media and mobile phone services provide significant 
opportunities to help improve communication and early warning effectiveness Drought and flood 
monitoring systems are also an important component of risk reduction
Mainstreaming gender and community involvement in decisionmaking processes are key elements to 
disaster risk reduction strategies Improved interagency coordination in water resources and disaster risk 
management is needed especially in transboundary basins where it remains fragmented throughout most 
of the worldWater reuse  
or reclaimed water  
is a reliable alternative 
to conventional 
water resources for 
a number of uses 
provided that it is 
treated andor used 
safelyExecutive Summary5Human health
Anticipated waterrelated health impacts of climate change are primarily food water and vectorborne diseases 
deaths and injury associated with extreme weather events such as coastal and inland flooding as well as 
undernutrition as a result or food shortages caused by droughts and floods Mental health impacts associated 
with illness injury economic losses and displacement may also be substantial although difficult to quantify
At the end of the Millennium Development Goals period 20002015 91 of 
the global population used an improved drinking water source and 68 used 
improved sanitation facilities Much remains to be done to reach the new higher 
levels of safely managed water supply and sanitation services as defined under 
the SDGs for the 22 billion and 42 billion people respectively who lack this 
superior level of service
Climate change is likely to slow or undermine progress on access to safely 
managed water and sanitation and lead to ineffective use of resources if systems 
design and management are not climateresilient By extension progress on 
the elimination and control of water and sanitationrelated disease will also be 
slowed or undermined by climate change
Food and agriculture
The specific challenges for agricultural water management are twofold The first is the need to adapt existing 
modes of production to deal with higher incidences of water scarcity and water excess flood protection and 
drainage The second is to decarbonize agriculture through climate mitigation measures that reduce GHG 
emissions and enhance water availability
The scope for adaptation in rainfed agriculture is determined largely by the ability of crop varieties to cope with 
shifts in temperature and to manage soil water deficits Irrigation allows cropping calendars to be rescheduled 
and intensified thus providing a key adaptation mechanism for land that previously relied solely on precipitation
In terms of equivalent tonnes of CO2 the largest contribution to agricultural GHG emissions is made by the 
release of livestock methane through enteric fermentation and manure deposited on pasture For forestry the 
greatest opportunity for mitigation involves reducing the emissions attributable to deforestation and forest 
degradation
Agriculture has two main avenues for mitigation of GHGs carbon sequestration through organic matter 
accumulation above and below the ground and emission reduction through land and water management 
including adoption of renewable energy inputs such as solar pumping 
ClimateSmart Agriculture CSA is a recognized suite of wellinformed approaches to land and water 
management soil conservation and agronomic practice that sequester carbon and reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions CSA practices help to retain soil structure organic matter and moisture under drier conditions and 
include agronomic techniques including irrigation and drainage to adjust or extend cropping calendars to 
adapt to seasonal and interannual climate shiftsClimate change 
is likely to slow or 
undermine progress 
on access to safely 
managed water and 
sanitationThe United Nations World Water Development Report 2020  Water and Climate Change6Energy and industry
The waterrelated effects of climate change generate risks to business and power generation Water stress can 
put a halt to manufacturing or energy generation Impacts will also carry into operational aspects affecting the 
supply of raw materials disrupting supply chains and causing damage to facilities and equipment  
Energy is in the spotlight of climate change initiatives as about twothirds of the 
worlds anthropogenic GHGs come from energy production and use There are 
a number of opportunities to mitigate GHGs and reduce water use at the same 
time Reducing energy demand and increasing energy efficiency are starting 
points One promising direction is the increased use of lowcarbon renewable 
energy technology with little water requirements such as solar photovoltaic PV 
and wind the costs of which are becoming increasingly competitive with fossil 
fuel energy generation While hydropower will continue playing a role in climate 
mitigation and adaptation of the energy sector the overall sustainability of single 
projects needs to be assessed taking account of potential water consumption 
through evaporation as well as GHG emissions from reservoirs not to mention 
the potential ecological and socioeconomic impacts 
For business water stress is one of the main drivers for water reuse and efficiency In concert with technology 
a facility could look at daytoday operations such as the use of washwater and better monitoring and leak 
detection On an expanded scale a company might evaluate its water footprint and include those of its suppliers 
which may have farreaching effects if they are large water users
 
Human settlements
The impacts of climate change on urban water systems include higher temperatures reduced precipitation and 
more severe drought on the one hand and increasing heavy precipitation and flooding events on the other It is 
precisely these extremes that make the planning of urban space and the provision of infrastructure so difficult
The physical infrastructure for delivery of water and sanitation facilities can also be disrupted leading 
to contaminated water supplies and the discharge of untreated wastewater and stormwater into living 
environments Vectorborne diseases such as malaria rift valley fever leptospirosis and others are often observed 
after flooding events
Urban water resilience goes way beyond the traditional city boundaries In cases where water supplies rely on 
distant watersheds planning needs to look well beyond the citys boundaries and consider the longterm impacts 
of urban expansion on distant freshwater ecosystems and the local communities that also rely on them
In small urban and rural settlements use of water for agriculture and in some cases industrial applications results 
in reduced availability for domestic uses Domestic supplies must be prioritized under the human rights to water 
and sanitationThe waterrelated 
effects of climate 
change generate 
risks to business and 
power generationExecutive Summary7Nexus Accounting for interlinkages
Adaptation and mitigation actions by one sector can directly influence its water demand which can in turn 
augment or reduce the localregional water availability including quality for other sectors In cases of reduced 
water demand such actions can lead to multiple benefits across sectors and boundaries whereas increased 
water demand can result in the need for tradeoffs over the allocation of limited supplies
Water use requires energy Therefore any reduction in water use has the potential to reduce the energy demand 
from the water sector and thus help mitigate climate change if said energy source is from fossil fuels 
Conversely energy production also requires water With their very low water requirements renewables such as 
wind solar PV and certain types of geothermal power generation are by far the best energy alternatives from a 
water demand perspective
Water efficiency measures in agriculture can increase water availability and reduce the energy needed for 
pumping in turn further reducing the water needed for energy production Increased use of renewable energy in 
agriculture eg solar PV pumps provide additional opportunities to lower GHG emissions and to support the 
livelihoods of smallholders Since agriculture accounts for 69 of global water withdrawals reducing food loss 
and waste could also have significant repercussions on water and energy demand and thereby reducing GHG 
emissions
Conservation agriculture allows soils to retain more water carbon and nutrients with additional ecological benefits 
The biomass and soils of properly managed forests wetlands and grasslands provide mitigation opportunities 
through carbon sequestration with significant additional benefits in terms of nutrient cycling and biodiversity
Improved approaches to the treatment of water and especially wastewater offer a range of mitigation 
opportunities Untreated wastewater is an important source of GHGs With more than 80 of all wastewater 
globally released to the environment without treatment treating its organic matter prior to its release can 
reduce GHG emissions The reuse of untreated or partially treated wastewater can reduce the amount of energy 
associated with water extraction advanced treatment and in cases where the wastewater is reused at or near the 
release site transportation The biogas produced from wastewater treatment processes can be recovered and 
used to power the treatment plant itself rendering it energyneutral and further enhancing energy savings 
Governance
Both climate and water management require mechanisms for oversight and coordination Sectoral fragmentation 
and bureaucratic competition may pose serious challenges for the integration across scales This calls for i 
greater public participation to discuss and manage climate risk ii building adaptive capacities at multiple levels 
and iii prioritizing risk reduction for socially vulnerable groups
Good governance involves adhering to principles of human rights including effectiveness responsiveness 
and accountability openness and transparency participation in the performance of key governance functions 
relating to policy and institutional arrangements planning and coordination and regulation and licensing For 
the integration of substance integrated water resources management IWRM provides a process to involve 
stakeholders across society the economy and the environment
Greater public participation to manage climate risk is suggested as a way to build adaptive capacities at multiple 
levels avoid institutional traps and prioritize risk reduction for socially vulnerable groups At the same time 
scientific information and data also need to be made available at the local level and included as information into 
local multistakeholder decision processesThe United Nations World Water Development Report 2020  Water and Climate Change8While governments remain responsible for leading national climate mitigation 
and adaptation measures as well as water governance the process of change is 
always coproduced There are many indications that young people are increasingly 
concerned about climate change Cities have also become forerunners of climate 
action in many countries and leading companies have made commitments to reduce 
their water footprint and GHG emissions in order to address their contribution to 
water stress and climate change
Poverty discrimination and vulnerability are closely related and typically intersect Women and girls from minority 
ethnic groups or from remote or disadvantaged areas may suffer multiple forms of exclusion and oppression 
When disasters hit such inequalities can become exacerbated making it more likely that poor people are affected 
Poor people are also likely to lose relatively more than the nonpoor
Finance
Current levels of financing are inadequate to reach the international communitys goal of universal availability and 
sustainable management of water and sanitation Proponents of water projects could aim to increase the water 
sectors share of climate finance and emphasize waters ties to other climaterelated sectors in order to ensure 
greater funding for water management
Two promising trends are generating opportunities for water projects to access climate finance The first is 
the increasing recognition of the mitigation potential within water and sanitation projects This trend could be 
particularly advantageous as mitigation made up 938 of climate financing in 2016 but water projects consisted of 
a fraction of 1 of that sum The second trend is an increasing emphasis on financing climate adaptation 
Accessing climate finance can be competitive and difficult especially for complex water projects that may 
transcend national boundaries Bankable climate projects are those that have a clearly articulated link to climate 
change impacts familiarity and strict compliance with funding procedures and sometimes additional funding 
sources In order to be considered bankable projects hoping to use climate finance must explicitly address the 
causes andor consequences of climate change Projects that communicate and address risks and capture co
benefits in other areas such as health are also considered more bankable 
Differentiated strategies that specifically consider the resilience needs of marginalized groups should also be built 
into larger waterclimate plans and projects
Technological innovation
The challenges in terms of technological innovation knowledge management research and capacity development 
are to promote the generation of new tools and approaches through advanced research and development and 
equally as important to accelerate the implementation of existing knowledge and technologies across all countries 
and regions However these actions will only lead to the intended outcomes if they are accompanied by awareness
raising as well as educational and capacity development programmes in order to widely disseminate the available 
knowledge and to stimulate the uptake of new and existing technologies
Satellitebased earth observation can help identify trends in precipitation evapotranspiration snow and ice cover
melting as well as runoff and storage including groundwater levels While remote sensing can reveal large
scale processes and features that are not easily observable via traditional methods the temporal and spatial 
resolution may not be fully adequate for smallerscale applications and data analysis However when backed with 
national statistics fieldbased observations and numerical simulation models remote sensing can contribute to a 
comprehensive assessment of climate change impacts related to waterThere are many 
indications that young 
people are increasingly 
concerned about 
climate changeExecutive Summary9Evolutions in the field of data acquisition have been facilitated by highspeed internet networks and global 
coverage as well as cloud computing and the enhancement of virtual storage capabilities Wireless sensors for 
monitoring water consumption have been developed and are increasingly used to allow for remote water metering 
Applications of big data analytics can help to obtain knowledge by processing the collection of continuous 
streams of waterrelated information and data in order to extract actionable information and insights for improved 
water management Citizen science and crowdsourcing have the potential to contribute to early warning systems 
and to provide data for validating flood forecasting models 
Regional perspectives
Domestic regulation of water resources development use conservation and protection forms the foundational 
pillar of water governance and is the prime instrument for the implementation of INDCs under the Paris Agreement
While twothirds of countries outline a general portfolio of water projects in their INDCs only one in ten cite what 
could be called a detailed project proposal and these originate either from domestic water planning processes 
or have emerged from previous climate funding proposals However the need for institutional reforms is well 
recognized in INDCs often prioritized alongside infrastructure investments
Regional approaches to support transformative shifts can play a critical role in nationallevel implementation by 
improving collaboration and coordination between responsible institutions ensuring that action is based on sound 
information and evidence and increasing access to both public and private finance for climateresilient investment
SubSaharan Africa
Impacts of climate variability on Africas water resources are already acute as exemplified by the recent decrease 
in rainfall in southern Africa Waterrelated impacts of climate change on human health are also expected through 
vector and waterborne diseases including by further challenging access to safe drinking water sanitation and 
hygiene and via malnutrition given expected impacts on food security In agricultural systems especially in semi
arid areas conventional livelihoodbased approaches appear not robust enough to deal with the longterm impacts 
of climate change
Policies and actions towards climate change adaptation and mitigation include supporting resilience to 
droughts and floods through investing in and improving the climate resilience of WASH facilities expanding 
social protection and introducing financial products like insurance enhancing gender equality in the use and 
management of water resources and improving water availability for agriculture through water harvesting 
mulching and reduced tillage in rainfed systems
Energy is politically important to fulfil the ambitions of many African countries in terms of economic 
transformation It could provide a catalyst to encourage regional cooperation to address challenges at the water
energyclimate nexus possibly opening up investment in regional power pools and the institutional mechanisms 
for energy trading
Europe Caucasus and Central Asia
Climate projections indicate increasing precipitation in northern Europe and decreasing precipitation in southern 
Europe The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC highlights increasing challenges for irrigation 
hydropower ecosystems and human settlements in the region
The key actions for more effective adaptation and more resilience to extremes in the region include enhanced 
water efficiency and water saving strategies monitoring and data sharing on water quantity and quality improving 
coherence of climate change adaptation and waterrelated disaster risk reduction and attracting funding from 
multiple sources eg international national and privateThe United Nations World Water Development Report 2020  Water and Climate Change10In transboundary basins technical and financial assistance can be shared up or downstream from wealthier to 
poorer riparian countries However even where funds are available transboundary water management can be 
politically difficult This points to the need to find a politically salient entry point around which to build cooperation 
In some cases climate change itself can be the factor that opens up the opportunity for cooperation
Latin America and the Caribbean
Climate variability and extreme events already severely affect the region In Central and South America observed 
streamflow and water availability changes are projected to continue affecting vulnerable regions
Rapid urbanization economic development and inequality are among the key socioeconomic drivers of pressure 
on water systems with which climate impacts intersect Poverty is persistent in most countries contributing 
to the vulnerability to climatic change Economic inequality also translates into inequality in access to water 
and sanitation and vice versa Increasing risks of waterborne diseases have a greater impact on poor people 
Vulnerability is also high in rural areas with climatic factors limiting economic options and driving outmigration
For many countries in the region climate change occurs against a backdrop of high levels of intersectoral 
competition for water including between urban areas the energy and agriculture sectors and ecosystem needs
The limited explicit mention of transboundary waterclimate issues in development strategies is symptomatic of 
wider challenges in cooperation on transboundary waters in Latin America and the Caribbean
Asia and the Pacific
There is high variation and low confidence in projected waterrelated impacts of climate change at the subregional 
scale in Asia and the Pacific The region is highly vulnerable to climateinduced disasters and extreme weather 
events which are disproportionately burdening poor and vulnerable groups Waterrelated climate impacts 
intersect with other socioeconomic trends that impact water quality and quantity including industrialization 
which is reshaping sectoral demand for water and increasing pollution population growth and rapid urbanization 
The latter have also increased exposure to waterrelated natural hazards such as floods
Climate change and increasing demand for water will put additional stress on the regions groundwater resources 
which are already experiencing severe stress in some areas due to increases in demand for irrigation
At the national level identified priorities to accelerate waterclimate action include enhancing water governance 
and water productivity to manage competition between the water needs of agriculture energy industry cities and 
ecosystems promoting naturebased solutions that can curb emissions and increase resilience and integrating 
climate change and disaster risk reduction across the entire project and policy cycle
Regional cooperation on investment and information as well as on institutional areas such as governance 
capacity and partnerships is urgently needed in Asias transboundary basins
Western Asia and North Africa
Vulnerability to climate change is moderate to high across the region with a generally increasing gradient 
from north to south Runoff and evapotranspiration generally follow the same trends as precipitation although 
evapotranspiration is limited by water scarcity
The areas with the highest vulnerability to climate change are in the Horn of Africa the Sahel and the southwestern 
part of the Arabian Peninsula which comprise several of the regions Least Developed Countries While their 
exposure to climate change varies they all exhibit low adaptive capacityExecutive Summary11Intersecting with broad challenges of climate change and limited adaptive capacity are complex socioeconomic 
and political dynamics affecting water at the regional national and subnational levels Politicization and 
weaponization of water resources displacement and degradation of water infrastructure have been major 
challenges for countries affected by conflict Inequalities in access to and control of water resources persist 
especially across urbanrural and gender lines
Regional stakeholders identified many priorities and opportunities relating to water including rendering urban 
development more sustainable enhancing data research and innovation increasing the resilience of vulnerable 
communities exposed to floods and droughts and threatened by food insecurity furthering policy integration 
between mitigation adaptation and sustainable development and increasing access to finance including via 
international climate funds and through the development of local markets and investment products 
The way forward
Given the crosscutting nature of water and climate through different economic sectors and across society trade
offs and conflicting interests need to be addressed at all levels in order to negotiate integrated and coordinated 
solutions This requires an equitable participatory multistakeholder approach to water governance in the context 
of climate change
There are increasing opportunities to more genuinely and systematically integrate adaptation and mitigation 
planning into water investments rendering these investments and associated activities more appealing to climate 
financiers Furthermore various waterrelated climate change initiatives can also provide cobenefits such as job 
creation improved public health reduced poverty the promotion of gender equality and enhanced livelihoods 
among others
Despite the mounting evidence that climate change is affecting the global hydrological cycle much uncertainty 
remains when projecting its impacts over smaller geographical and temporal scales However this uncertainty 
must not be seen as an excuse for inaction Rather it should serve as an impetus to expand research to promote 
the development of practical analytical tools and innovative technologies to adopt noregrets approaches and to 
build the institutional and human capacity required to foster informed sciencebased decisionmaking
The need for greater cooperation between the water and climate communities exists well beyond the realm of 
scientific research On the one hand it is imperative that the climate change community and climate negotiators 
in particular give greater attention to the role of water and recognize its central importance in addressing the 
climate change crisis On the other hand it is equally if not more essential that the water community focuses 
its efforts to promote the importance of water in terms of both adaptation and mitigation to develop concrete 
waterrelated project proposals for inclusion in NDCs and to strengthen the means and capacities to plan 
implement and monitor waterrelated activities in NDCs
Combining climate change adaptation and mitigation through water is a winwinwin proposal First it benefits 
water resources management and improves the provision of water supply and sanitation services Second 
it directly contributes to combating both the causes and impacts of climate change including disaster risk 
reduction Third it contributes directly and indirectly to meeting several of the Sustainable Development Goals 
hunger poverty health energy industry climate action and so on  not to mention SDG 6 the water goal itself 
and a host of other global objectives
In an era characterized by a host of gloom and doom studies and articles on climate change and other global 
environmental crises this report proposes a series of practical responses in terms of policy financing and 
action on the ground to support our collective objectives and individual aspirations to achieve a sustainable and 
prosperous world for allPrepared by WWAP  Richard Connor
