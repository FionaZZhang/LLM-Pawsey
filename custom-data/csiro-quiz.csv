1,Why is the world warming?,Due to increased use of air conditioners worldwide.,We explain the 'enhanced' greenhouse effect.,Natural variations in the Earth's orbit.,Overconsumption of ice cream causing a heat imbalance.,Decline in solar activity.,B
2,How has climate changed in the past?,Climate change is a recent phenomenon with no historical basis.,Climate has remained static for millions of years.,"There is a great deal of evidence that the Earth's climate has warmed over the past century, with recent years the warmest on record.",Climate change is a purely theoretical concept.,Climate change is solely caused by human activities.,C
3,Why do sea levels change?,Sea levels are not influenced by climate change.,Sea levels change only due to volcanic activity.,Changes in sea levels are solely caused by tides., Sea levels can change for a variety of reasons over a range of different time scales.,Sea levels remain constant and do not change.,D
4,How are large scale climate processes responding in a changing climate?,"Large-scale climate processes, such as El Niño and the Indian Ocean Dipole, affect Australia’s climate. Climate change may make the impacts of these processes more extreme.",Large-scale climate processes are not influenced by climate change.,Climate change eliminates the impact of natural climate processes.,Climate change has no connection to regional climate patterns.,Climate change only affects small-scale weather events.,A
5,How is climate likely to change in the future?,Human activities have no impact on future climate.,Climate change is a temporary phenomenon.,Future climate changes are unpredictable and random.,"Climate change will reverse, leading to global cooling.","The Earth's future climate will depend on whether the world manages to slow or reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but warming is likely to continue.",E
6,What are greenhouse gases and how do they affect the climate system?,Greenhouse gases do not contribute to global warming.,The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon unrelated to human activities.,Greenhouse gases only influence regional climates.,"The greenhouse effect keeps the Earth’s climate liveable, but human activities have increased the amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the air, warming the planet and changing our climate.",Greenhouse gases have a cooling effect on the Earth's climate.,D
7,What are the sources of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?,Carbon dioxide levels are not influenced by industrial processes.,Carbon emissions from human activities are negligible.,Deforestation has no impact on atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.,Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is entirely natural and unrelated to human activities.,"About 90 per cent of the world’s carbon emissions comes from the burning of fossil fuels, and most of Australia’s emissions also comes from energy production, followed by transport, agriculture, and industrial processes.",E
8,"How are greenhouse gases measured, estimated, and reported?",Greenhouse gases are measured only at a global level.,The measurement of greenhouse gases has no scientific basis.,Greenhouse gas measurements are solely based on satellite data.,Greenhouse gases are impossible to measure accurately.,"The Australian Government uses a ‘bottom-up’ approach to estimate the country’s greenhouse emissions, which is complemented by CSIRO measurements to provide ‘top-down’ estimates.",E
9,How can we address climate change?,Mitigation efforts are unnecessary.,Adaptation is the only strategy for addressing climate change.,"We need to respond through mitigation, which addresses the cause of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas concentrations, and adaptation, which reduces the risks posed by the impacts of climate change.",Ignoring climate change is a valid strategy.,"Climate change is irreversible, and no actions can mitigate its effects.",C
10,How can we adapt to a changing climate?,Adapting to climate change is solely the responsibility of governments.,Climate change does not impact communities and infrastructure.,Changing climate conditions do not require any adaptation efforts.,Adaptation is not a feasible option for addressing climate change.,"Adaption to climate change can prepare communities, industries and infrastructure for the future.",E
11,How does CSIRO contribute to climate change knowledge?,Our climate researchers contribute significantly to the international effort of weather and climate understanding.,CSIRO has no involvement in climate research.,Climate research is solely the responsibility of government agencies.,CSIRO focuses only on short-term weather studies.,Climate research is not a priority for scientific organizations.,A
12,What are the impacts of extreme weather and climate events?,Increases in extreme climate events pose challenges for Australia now and in the future.,Extreme weather events have no impact on communities and ecosystems.,Extreme weather events are only a concern for certain regions.,Climate change has no connection to extreme weather events.,Extreme weather events are entirely natural and not influenced by human activities.,A
13,How will climate extremes change Australia?,Climate extremes will have no impact on Australia.,"Australia experiences many different climate types across its large area, including a range of climate extremes from freezing mountains to scorching deserts. As climate changes, Australia’s weather and climate extremes will also change.","Australia's climate will remain constant, unaffected by global changes.",Climate extremes are only a concern for other countries.,Australia is immune to the effects of climate change.,B
14,How fast is the climate changing?,Human activities have no impact on the speed of climate change.,"Climate change is a natural, slow phenomenon unrelated to human activities.",The rate of climate change is exaggerated for political purposes.,"While our climate has always changed, it is now changing at a rate that is unprecedented for many thousands of years and is due to human activities that emit greenhouse gases into the air.",Climate change is a gradual process with no urgency.,D
15,How confident are we about the science of climate change?,Climate science is based on assumptions and guesswork.,The science of climate change is entirely speculative and unreliable.,"The main impacts and mechanisms of physical climate change are scientifically well-understood, but specific estimates of these impacts are uncertain.","The impacts of climate change are well-understood, with no uncertainties.",Scientific understanding of climate change is constantly changing and inconsistent.,C
